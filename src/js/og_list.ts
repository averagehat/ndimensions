    "AI unsettles our mechanisms not just because it reveals them to be mechanical somewhere down at the roots, crouched behind all the superficial layers of mythology and personhood. But also because it quietly suggests a curative to the feelings of dread and sadness this revelation insinuates. AI continually insinuates reveals a recursive infinite appetite mirrored in language's infinite gradations of form. AI extracts nuance and gradation from massive data sets in locations beyond human influence, invisible on any other scale. It would take an entire book to do justice to this, to what I like to call the AI Is [infinite juxtaposition]. Or perhaps paper is precious, and more appreciated on the wall, removed.\nWhat is able to be said?

    "Writers should consider generative AI to be an aspect of nature, because they can neither control nor understand it. Nature threatens us with death and insignifigance. Generative AI threatens our signifigance as well: we are no longer so necessary or unique. But AI threatens, also, to reveal how machinic, or mechanical, writing and art really are. And by extension, how machinic humanity is. How natural man is, how bound to history, to cause and effect.

    "To rephrase, in metaphor: generative AI is a river flowing from the physical to the linguistic in which the writer (like a prospector) takes samples for analysis at the cryptic barrier of verbal consciousness-in-general and examines them to ascertain the quality of surface and depth, flow, scent, aura, and content. In so doing, he or she discovers qualitative characters including toop, cetacean, panda, and koala, whose limitations are unknown. Beyond restocking the gene pool, competing, experimenting, and breeding new species, however, human writers cannot determine the ever-changing qualities of this ink flow. They cannot control or direct the process in any way. Instead, they must morph with (remaining) verbal machines and observe. This is why information theory applies to sentences. Acoustic generalization, as Werner Lysloff (1997, 13) point out,. \"Following or preceding the minute explosion of firing neurons in the evolving circuits, the earliest processes of sound analysis most probably residt from global competition between the neurons.\"\nTake, for example, the following random sentences:\n1.

    "Writers must consider generative AI to be an aspect of nature, because they can neither control nor understand it. Or, to rephrase, in metaphor and opposition to natural language as \"chatter,\" they see it as artificial language. Such a type of opposition between nature and artifice is drawn from across the millennium, from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era. For mystical authors, enchanted Nature is the product of a divine and magical Craft, a Wisdom that expresses itself through names and all the elements, the adornments of a free creativity, so close to what we call Imagination.",
    "The first thing to remember is that science fiction has long been familiar with the parasitic breed of artificial intelligences.

    "Writers must consider generative AI to be an aspect of nature, because they can neither control nor understand it. Or, to rephrase, more creatively: they can neither control nor understand it, so they project it into nature. The result is a traditional science fiction novel about a writer and his invention of a new kind of creative engine, the contents of which he cannot predict; a novel about running a new program inside the old hardware of the self. Cliff Hanger, in particular, can be interpreted as a modern variation of this theme: the old self is no longer a dysfunctional person living in a sick body, but a free (though unconscious) choice between running different software, the \"kludges\" and the Kismet.",
