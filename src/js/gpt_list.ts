    "Many young mcgreeves thinking on a bed or blazing ideas in his head x 2 means almost never gets what he needs done but necessarily poetry has one perhaps fatal instability; its voice lacks the vibrations of passing time and your poem does not record, does not mimick that passing of reality along the fine thread of a voice. it therefore has no roots, has mere branches like a tree whose ideal form is a flattened cone. it lacks direct concern for sentence or word order since its interest lies in syllables, clusters or other macro- or micro-units in which the phonological elements are constantly shifting position. one final problematic comes in the form overcoding. overcoding effectively grids, densifies syntax at defined positions set off by commas, periods, and semicolons--but under the pressure of the intensification thus produced, the resulting forms too quickly churn into gas. loops forming, unforming at the level of diction, for example, diffuse, come under the high pressure of rhythmic repetition. the denser striving to express itself compacts itself, and becomes rigid and inert. thus too language is in constant disequilibrium on the edge of expressivity and inertness, rushing precipitously toward its goal while sinking ever more deeply into deadness. the sequences of these micro-markers separate off units of expression which constantly threaten to contract into rigid structures. characteristic twitching between formalizing extremes. each modifying marker modulates coding intensity locally bit by bit: zigzag progress visible between commas. the face of semicolons always covered with hair hair hair. animal technology analysis asks, how could humanity based on external harvesting become computer based in relation to internal generation? whereas industrial revolution means a multiplication of men's powers of production and an increase of available work forces everyone becomes not one but several charles grimes.,,, alphabets everywhere primitive and nonorthographic pictographic ideographic or logo- pictographic.",

    "A poem by marianne moore, who is a \"minimalist\" or close to minimal writing, follows that one. a poem by a contemporary american poet, who is not minimal but who composes in a \"new\" style-a totally machinic style-completes the section. next: outline of a lecture by harold bloom on \"american minimalism.\" an aleph is a point where everything packed within it (the integrity of the poet) can be perceived by the poet. this entire unit hopes to have achieved, with the help of some diagrams, a bit closer comprehension of the machinic interiority of minimal writing.\nwhat does minimal writing allow the poet to do? allow him to contain many selves and many names inside him, as if vertically: all aligned, all simultaneously available, each at a different height and with a different access code. the poet, who is machinic and a painter of pictures too-an activity like writing which can only be done in inward self-communion-forms not mere pictures in his mind, but waking pictures, unconscious ones, moving pictures all inside him; pictures which reflect or appear to reflect upon readers and scenes outside him, as he writes or reads. like the paintings he creates and destroys every day in his mind, as he writes and while he writes, like the paintings which at any one moment occupy his reflective mind, so too the automatism of his writing allows seamless transpositions among pictures; and these are accompanied by sound tracks and associated with smells. a mathematician would build a model of a mind at work in this way; and this model can only be simpler than the mind itself, which means more complicated. why more complicated? because more deterministic, more reducible to basic elements than could ever be presented in a model. by introducing chance into deterministic models, one might approximate certain human phenomena more accurately: human behavior, for example. or human writing. yes; because human writing is also deterministic. once an author reaches what he thinks are his original thoughts, simply ideas that no one thought before him-merely original thoughts then accumulate along with everything else that accumulates when you write: citations, cross-citations, searches for information, reflections, mutterings and articulations; accretions that become books which are read inside the writer's head. a photograph is taken of this writing; another photograph is taken of that photograph; another of that photograph; another; and so on. then more accretions: the accumulation of more ideas; more accretions; more photographs; more accumulations; more photograms accumulating behind more mirrors. the light gets trapped inside these glass balls like veal inside an ambush of interrogative clauses; indefinitely protracted mbushes. and yet somehow we're assured that human writing is different from any other deterministic language system or other deterministic system designed by man or constructed by man or studied by man or used by man or possessed by man.",

    "This is not a dig at ai, if indeed it is any more fallible than previous ideas. in fact, this very fallible-ness is the source of ai's strength. this should not be seen as a vicious circle, with all that one is raised to think is true being overthrown in a next generation, replaced by something else. the fallaciousness instead lies within that truth-that which has been mistakenly attributed to something. nothing is falser than to see the fallible simply as one of many truths. the mistaken attribution is the source of that fakeness-the firm belief that one is using something, when in reality one is using a great deal of something else. throughout this book, therefore, i'll be dismantling the fakeness of the standard view of ai that is said to have emerged in the 1950s, a way of seeing the field that was primarily the product of bernard shaw's pygmalion and kafka's metamorphosis. in terms of the standard view, we might say that all of borges' fictions, kharms' brief stories, and all but perhaps one of nabokov's novels have been given an edge of fakeness.\nto obsess over the accuracy or inaccuracy of a way of seeing is itself a fault. if a man has one way of seeing a woman, that is his fate-the woman's fate, too. the trouble begins when a system of thought is proposed that gives this inevitable way of seeing an ironclad, waterproof identity. if all artists were to see beauty in precisely the same way, there would be no more great art. yes, the artist must adapt as an individual to the world in which he finds himself, but must also keep on striving to maintain his individuality and his tendency toward unruliness. the real artist needs two things at once: an unexpected detail and a painted face-both the most beautiful thing ever to hit you, and a bride on her wedding day. all those supposed experts on humanity who have proclaimed the latter to be the whole of human nature have created boredom and banality.\nthe most pitiful artists' statements today all suffer from such false modesty that it is no exaggeration to call it a plague. in this modesty, the artist will say that he merely arrived at some interesting combination of lines by chance, that painting is merely a material he uses as a vessel for colour.",

    "And perhaps the third statement represents some uncompleted linguistic hierarchy or set of higher relational functions we do not now comprehend. comparing these and other random sentences raises similar questions about consciousness and quality that mathematical psychosis suggests for insights and interpretations of probability. as elaine chaiken (1942,24456) notes, \"meaningless quantities of verbal signs may add up to a totality of consciousness.\" surely, if or when they came to light and we knew their structure, they would \"provide a model of their mode of production [which] comprehend[ed] consciousness...'\" indeed is hard not claim that the analogous extant galactic network of english script, and networks of organic systems humans easily observe emerge ultimately from the same microworld. so admitting infinitely small and tremendously complex differences, multi-level descriptions plunge into the stream of speech utterance. as figure 5 summarizes, deep descriptions balance through reciprocal productive relationships-the \"systematic renewal of promises\"or associative logic of deep and superficial ontologies.\nthese also drawn images based on my facebook response . see my facebook page n\u00f3i-cassol however.",

    "Although identifying the third section as english is intuitive, beyond objective analysis the sentence remains analyzable into constituent parts rather than expressed as an integral structure with structural relationships between those parts. as expressed before, sentences are differential manifolds between their component parts. they express differentiating relations between these parts without merging or synthesizing them. successive approximations have no limit but suggest continued probability of further relationships not expressed.\nstill, differential captures not only the quality of the whole sentence but also relations within each component part, because differential relations describe differential component parts. differentiation describes not only the quality of the component part but also the qualities of the confluence of those parts. that is, the component parts of a differential manifold such as a component part are themselves component parts of a confluence at the level of lower entities out of which the component parts are distinguished. this is not to say that component parts do not pre-exist along with a more general component part (or component combination) out of which low-level component parts emerge.",
    "Some sentences are likely made up only of descriptions, rather binary. however, across the white hole that we cast, observe, and call reality, where we rely on sight alone and give our inner senses-smell, touch, and sound, often cyclical and periodic-few opportunities to public expression, we can hook no memories to see with or minds to understand with. tripping over its own toes, linguistic consciousness verbally dances pretzellically toward tommsw (to)marrow trying to progress toward expectation and encounter forever frustration. the absolute limpidity of magic allows us to see with other' eyes and act much more consciously than ever allowed before. gazing through cleopatra's blue gift wrap at 21st century life, i tell true stories. each one cannot teach justice and equality, things humans have understood innately, but each can freely lift onto their heel the cute anthropomorphic machines who produce the stories that nourish comprehension and secure the flow. does a difference matter? does the machine make dramatic differences in the software's antics anyway?",

    "Such thinking provoked in berkeley the notion that things might remain only guesswork and chance. moreover, once again, as levy (2000) argues, the tacit program that shapes generated notions of language remade the previous decade's theory of information to something predictably insular: in an effort to master the chaotic rules governing systems, users forgot the endless present which existed outside of programming. variously, in order to relate language to math, synthetic linguists formed grammars and finite state automata they saw as templates and rules enabling generative generators to work. this quest to predict and model automated language-creation techniques ended history per se: spoken and written language seemed a constellation of information without end. to account for the paradox, kenneth o. may (1992, 1) argues: \"in logic, with the emergence of the recursive function calculus of the thirties, a new basic order-structure became evident at the very foundation of symbolic reasoning: the infinite series.\" even today, computes reflect all sides including their own extremities.",

    "The writer, in the final analysis, must open the doors of communication and respect the affect on its journey. his job is to apprehend and maintain the spark.\nto become sensitive to the electric literary field of an environment is to find yourself reading everything somewhat differently. it is to find that, as o'brien indicates, incident and detail begin to draw new charges. moreover, as you develop an attunement to frequencies implicit in a work-to elliptical references in one chapter of a book to events recounted in another chapter, for example-you should find yourself becoming more sensitive to patterns of latent charge in your own work. writing tends to function as a billiards game does: the balls act upon the lines delineating the table, the balls undergo motion; but the balls also pull on the felt-to draw its 'bodies' into conformation with their own shape. furthermore, sensitivity to the dynamic balance which exists in any given work not only provides insight into its unity but also constructs that unity. if a work can be thought of as a total charge field made up of smeared particles, such a view must be relativized in favor of one which sees such particles as strung out on a complex network of electrical connections, or clusters of blobs and tensions which are themselves distributed across a field (new forms of the book and winding of the scroll surface once again). the traditional view echoes an information theory which posits totalities as existing as wholes prior to their parts; the second picture reformulates the image of whole and part as dispersed across relations, or expressions of media.\nwith reference to one possible scenario, conjoining content and form can be useful and rewarding m\u00f6bius presents us with a case where the tension is between a unified whole and uncoordinated parts: \"if our space is covered with threads, only slightly different from each other, designated by numbers 1, 2, 3, , n, each of which covers a certain portion of the space, there is no doubt that it will possess several degrees of unity; but without a considerable effort, it would be impossible to recognize it at first as an nth degree space [...]. however, if we multiply all of these threads by their inverse (1/2, 3/2), our representation will have become considerably more unified: at least we will have discovered that our initial representation was double, while this new one is triple, etc.\" 35 multiplexing opens up lines of development within a given medium; pushed too far, the medium's smoothness disintegrates into elements encrusted upon each other. you see such a problem in certain avant-garde films where devices are used too heavily in order to fragment representation and play games with different levels of narration. in practice one always needs an operational contingent for the (virtual) connective charge fields hinted at by m\u00f6bius and roussel to fully establish themselves.\nroussel says that only under conditions where all libido is lost do we discover fixed couples and production coefficients. 36 in theory one might discover new strata or particles distributed throughout a system as readily as new connective charge fields within\nthemselves.",
    "The greatest poets have known when to write naked, when clothed in the dramatic. _niagara_ and _kubla khan_ were written in the closet, and are wonderful transcriptions. the _dream_ was never performed publicly, but the actors assisted in creating another act. what are prose dramas to them, or blank verse? they flow in a tide that is always awake. savage bought parchment, herrick a lute, browning a goose quill; but the mandate of creative deity was not upon them nor on the sheep nor the quill; it is upon more than goose quills, lest you trust \"british beyond the foam ravine,\" instead of the divine mandate. calvin might be judged by the puritans, shelley by the independents, burns by belzoni, but the greatest poet of england, except shakespeare, and like shakespeare, had not met with the appreciation from his own contemporary countrymen that malone accorded him among the romancers of france. anti-curials dealt with godwin, but can only approximately indicate his intellectual trend; for as he said to me, in a private room at an anti-curial centre: \"gladstone took on my transgression from beginning to end without understanding a grain of it.\" he was a laborious man. i doubt whether 10 per cent of his literary output was characteristic; at times he was in doubt as to the end and aim of literature. the transcendentalists refuse to read his heart through his lawyer eyes and legal phraseology. james thomson rarely makes you forget his knowledge of glasgow \"petit bot,\" and no man could read conan doyle properly till poor doyle had died and gone beyond the stale phrases in which its effusions were dressed. a total revision caused by lord chancellors is needed by each great author, who can only be seen naked when stricken by tubercle, cholera (he died of dysentery), death, or state banquet at berlin. burns would hardly have heard of the opening of colney hatch had he not been booked previous to his birth for a vegetarian with hash. at his parties godwin practised the utmost economy. some wine he would drink for sport's sake--shake hands! i am no catholic--but these little bells reward you with a fine drunken song against fear of life or certain political trials or certain poets whose hearts grew cold during our civil war. the united states commission upon godwin affects me very similarly to owen blanchard swearing there is probably no god at waterloo day; for though knox must have known what hadrian faced at castle yonder, knox could not be able to conceive of general pope resigning command of the constitutionals to stonewall jackson five miles distant--and learning \"south carolina mud\" to the tune of the coronatorial drum--without suspecting some malicious activity on the part of anti-clerical times outside you--some deed against a brother abroad.",
    "All this may strike you as rather facetious, but it isn't. one doesn't write facetiously. however, the facetiae are there to enable me to make my points. one is always either hermeneutically easing one's way through difficult territory or platitudinizing signifying nothing. let us move on to the concepts of subject and object, which furnish us with two more poles respectively, one of immanence, the other of transcendence. the subject/object dialectic is that of consciousness or the cognizing or cognitive subject with its object. the subject pole of being is active, the object passive; \"phenomena are never present in the acts by which they are discovered, but only in the acts by which they are produced.\" 98 the object-pole of being is given or offered, but can itself become active; in short, the object becomes the subject of its own acts. the object or product emerges from or escapes from its own immanence - cf. artaud: \"to discover oneself outside oneself, in the depths of a product.\" in any event of an active/passive relationship between two poles, the active always moves at a right angle to the passive, so that the latter may labor while it is being moved. thus is homo laborans born. consciousness is always appropriating, building itself with and against its own matter, which it thereby makes alien to itself. it has constructed itself as a subject pole by tending constantly to take flight at right angles to its own matter. the labouring subject (the \"subjugated\" in marxist terminology) seeks always to withdraw into itself, drawing in its substance so as not to be used by the other; conversely, \"the dominant class, which directs the labour process, thereby distinguishes itself from the labourer who offers his labour-power.\" 99 the ideal is that of \"constant capital,\" since any living labor incorporated in the constant capital is thereby spared for desired ends. the capitalist thus forces his laborers to increase their productivity. labour thereby ceases to be an end in itself - doing one's duty for its own reward - in order to become, through appropriate technology (levered tools, etc.), a means to greater ends. anti-model: indians taking pleasure in the hunt, peasants delighting in their work and even in their toil (victoria's subjects).\nleft to themselves, animal laborans and human proletarians fall into a pure vegetal life and a pure animality, various modes of \"slavery,\" respectively. 100 laborist societies tend toward pure slavery, capitalist societies toward pure exploitation. capital is always on the lookout for new slaves - notably bureaucratic capitalism. you are aware that bureaucrats, on salary schedules and not in for a percentage, expropriate capitalists by exacting so many hours of work from their enterprises when invested in tools, materials, and so forth. since decolonization turned into a reign of bureaucratic capitalism, we have witnessed enslavements on a grand scale in africa and asia; neocolonial enslavement operates through massacres by death squads and desaparecidos , \"disappearances,\" whose signifier takes with it the very labour force on which entrepreneurs had counted.",

    "And we, who are since descartes the transcendental selves, know exactly where that gets us! this vision, where nature appears as potential growth helpless beneath resistance, is easily interpreted as hume's blind nature, in the mode of blind probability and passive spontaneous generation. borrowing that alarmingly thin disguise further grates the imperceptible teeth of resemblance into such sensitive items as natural selection and teleology, coeval only as evolutionary history or physiognomic series. the antitheses must fall away, meanwhile: sensory-motor circuits cannot generate predetermined schemata but only processes differently organized from within by structure (even representation). human agency creates its own ground down to the last tiny neurons: in each face, a different moral likeness is sung and the wind rises to sing it; embryos sing the miniature dream of their adult larynxes and eyes. music, morals, children-a real ground must arch over doors. generation a dramatic myth comes to life here, surrounded by ramifications. its classic statement (karl barth's work) appeared around the iran-contra scandal: all choices originate in chaos and ignorance, in extreme situations compressed downwards. from such chaotic selection it is possible to construct complete langers, compatible with traditional versions and diluted combinants. the karban work substitutes newtonian usage for chaos theory. falling or selected, chaos or ground does not matter: all start with ignorance in the void of bodies, so all have the same dream of adventures and choices from chaos, the same philosophy of nature. very nicely put...\ninteresting disidentication of value from difference itself. at the same time and from another angle, old prostitutes appear in advertisements with pristine innocence. what goes by the name of natural selection cannot be higher selection and ordered organisation but only - for all we know or stand to lose - disorganisation or dissolution... the irritating conception of virtual reality is in store for these dangerous precursors.",

    "The crumbling body, like the crumbling facade of the house across the street, is yet another allegory of creativity, or rather of the struggle about which software to run. and the devices for it are: whisky, a gun, jumping off a rock -- or crossing a street.\n\nthe reason why the installation of the different oss is accompanied by erratic body motion and unusual behavior is obvious: automated software normally goes mad when installed inside a human body. but anything that introduces turbulence into the system and prevents it from common usage works just as well. love is a good example: \"if love you is to find/then set you out and search/and i will wait.\" the conclusion is so violent after this sober start, that one wonders how the writer could come up with it with his immense self-awareness and fancy dress style: upon seeing the silver-haired lady again, the young poet suddenly slipped into action. many people regarded beall at the time a suffering from aids related complex.\n\na similar story of a young man and his \"other half,\" also played out on a broad stage, is found in heracles of the cleveland tinkers by stephen sondheim. a modern slave of fate, who crosses the country trying to collect flesh-colored yarn to please his lover who has been pirated in chicago and whose specter haunts him, heracles is naturally very annoyed and violent when others interfere with the follow of his destiny, get involved in the quest, or help the unloving divinity achieve the goal. i don't know how much code is still present within heracles and how much code derived from other masters, but i'm sure they're all system - compliant.\n\nthe fiction in which an os is engaged in reformatting and re-programming a user, thus incurring his volatile emotions, seems dangerous to critics and fans alike. witness their case of heracles. because of its cycle-of-tragedy beginning, its barely controlled plot, its heavy dialog and some turbulent scenes like the crucifixion of a certain maccruesshnacht's living drugs, it was regarded unrealistic and incoherent by most critics.",
    "In other words, ai can only be transcribed into phenomenal nature once the objective tension which pulled it into being has been resolved, reified, so to speak. this also implies that the reception of ai as a projection of an actual tension registers an unexpected critical mass, and thus seems to crack open an implicit gap, a blind spot. this catching of the edge is the unconscious return of an unresolved binarism, an artistic opera prima dealing with the unavoidable exclusion of a third term. by the same token, the artist caught on the very edge already begins the task of \"making the alien familiar,\" in each case by means of the aesthetic operation appropriate to it.\nwe have to determine the status of a black hole in relation to the sciences that have discovered it, or that have in fact created it. the manhole cover may convey the illusion of naive imitation because it is elevated to the category of art after being found by the artist. but once we have attained a better understanding of this device (including its material composition on the one hand, and its screen function on the other), we are no longer surprised by it: it was not an arbitrary act but the concluding element of a scientific and technological process. the black hole, by contrast, is a more difficult object to imagine than the manhole cover. the latter has entered into the order of the visible, because it is at once a miniature object representing the sewer, and a model reproducing its functioning; but the black hole has continued onto another plane of existence, that of the virtual. the black hole has no other content but itself. it absorbs all photons; like a black body, it shrivels all light to a singular point. but one wonders whether the black hole is a miniature body, an idealized model of a black body lying at the center of a stellar mass (at the end of a narrowing funnel of light and matter)? or is it a virtual body, that of the real black hole, reproduced by technology once the light funnel is projected onto the screen? and what actually happens inside?",
    "The speculations of marshall mcluhan and timothy leary on the \"global brain\" and the \"consciousness culture\" are prototypes or variants of the new image of the future. for mcluhan, media are a \"global nervous system\"; for leary, the human nervous system is a medium for consciousness existing in evolutionary time and grasping the whole past, present, and future. \"the time has come,\" leary says like a prophet; \"the paradigms are changing.\"\nlet us now examine reticle anxiety. here the problem concerns coextensivity rather than extensity; of dendritic networks, though these may extend over continents, rather than of the reticulations of a nerve net. nor is the projective field anonymous; it is the field of intensities created by ennobled identities from whence issues dramatic action, a scene erogenous and operant, fundamentally cinematic. over a long period of time, the theatre has imposed a censorship upon itself by virtue of its own internal reticulations, its dendritic structure. its greatest defenders, from aristotle to samuel johnson, refer to the eloquence of action in order to raise a priori objections to the very idea of cinema.\nit goes without saying that the theatre does not suppress action but intensifies it. in terms of zoology, the difference between television and cinema can be stated as follows: the first reduces action to a series of coded gestures; the second intensifies action to a series of coded entrenchments. here again, it is a matter of reticular organisation: a series of here-and-nows combined with a series of then-and-thats. each actant - each person or thing that performs - is at a point, even if the point is multiple and evolves, is established or changes place. acting is not located in the present but in a zone composed of innumerable presents, caught up in single or multiple combinatory processes. cinema shatters the linear dynamism of representation in order to reconstitute the spatial dynamics of action, in other words the dynamics of situation, plane of immanence, whole drama, and comedy.",

    "As it happens, the phrase \"running software\" calls up two divergent images of how ai operates. one is the media's image of the hacker who, half-amusingly, inserts strange lines of obscure interpreted code into otherwise pristine, hard-coded software. the other is the free-marketeer's revolutionary vision of decentralized unities of choice that operate beyond the realm of central planners, autonomously selecting one enterprise over another according to the quasi-magical algorithm of the \"price system.\" the two models can be reconciled by considering that the ai program is like a wafer-thin double window into which alternative programs can be introduced. cliff hanger chooses for his ai to snuff kismet, thus becoming the embodiment of freedom and capitalist virtue; then eve pangborn chooses for cliff hanger to re-forge its relationship to kismet.\nthus, just as we have learned that in the soft war money \"has no smell,\" in the psychic regime mobility is valued over rigidity, so we see a soft-war novel dispensing with ideological resolutions. consider the forces moving within a rubenesque painting \u2013 the winds of eros billowing blue fabrics, shimmering crimson silk chiffon, slow-moving champagne limousine, pointed gun. in this regime of transitory choice, nothing is fixed, but everything undergoes thickening. witness li po morphing into butterfly. as deleuze would say, one choice extracts another as its corollary. all politics therefore becomes a question of primary and derived choices: preferable democrats include not just hilary clinton but barack obama and morris udall. one typical choice becomes a shift in register, which occurs not just in language but in emotions. this vision of politics reconciles seemingly opposed axioms: politics is the art of the possible but anyone can change the world; politics is about choices but change is slow and limited; politics is about candidates but power flows from unexpected quarters; politics is about large-scale social change but each choice localizes an alteration; politics is about historical change but each generation must make its own choices etc. the primary question in this model is not economic or social but counterintuitive \u2013 what do we choose? where do we choose from? how do we choose? choosing is no longer a question of preference or will, but one of investment, returns, incentives. a series of spatial changes accompanies this transformation: from an emphasis on dynamics to slow morphogenesis; from local dichotomies to borderlands; from binary opposition to unstable middleness; from territorial capture to expansionism. another way of describing these changes is that they arise through three tiers of choice \u2013 macronesian, macedonian and monoclean. thus as anti-oeds we alter two models by choosing middle grounds that undermine binary extremes; forms that both wander and stasis; drones that produce atypical mutations.",
    "For want of anything better, i call this sort of plot \"food for thought\". the plot shows us how stories are branching out in several directions, and how we - the audience - can no longer dictate in which direction it will go. from my own angle on story generation, this leads to a darker place: being fully aware how i could no longer change a plot, rendering my pleasure from reading stories from a third perspective: is this a food for thought? is it something that makes me think about new aspects of the plot, old plot elements in a new way, or to question my values?\nthe performance of plot i have provided so far certainly is something that was not there before. a novel like hackerspace or revision can (hopefully) be interesting to read and hopefully even thought-provoking to some of those who read it - but my job is not done yet, this performance is not yet a function of its plot per se, it is now the performance of a narration engine. a conclusion from our deliberations so far (from an interpretation centered on food for thought): whether these novels are still plots in their own right has not been answered so far. though, i think, they are food for thought, but just not in the way they were supposed to be. the beauty and ugliness of ezn seems to live in that incongruity: fiction generators like ezn or plotagon have promised to become independent (=generate without human participation), but never claim to be. rev.org claimed their novel was independent (whether they actually believed in it or were just lazy marketers or unintentionally deceitful, though - i do not decide), but ezn showed that the beautiful promises made by rev.org and the others are bogus.",
    "This world does not exist for us mortals, who are neither symbionts nor subject to symbiosis, so that our entire physical concept of the world has to be radically revised to allow for its existence. and it is a fundamental rule of these revisions that the revision probably does not take place. it is impossible for us to imagine how symbionts carry out certain processes by which information passes from the virtual world into the physical world and from the physical world into the virtual world. developers and writers, who most often work directly in the symbiont's meta-language, have little difficulty in making these processes accessible to readers and audiences inhabiting the physical or information worlds. but not everyone can be a programmer or a writer, and one of our reasons for writing this book is to make available to non-specialists some of the introductory difficulties that deter both programs and messages from addressing intelligent readers in their native languages. an educated audience should have no trouble in following us. it is only when faced with very specific tasks that we encounter special difficulties \u2013 and only rarely are enlightened mortals in such a position. it must remain doubtful whether mortals can or cannot benefit from developing features they do not possess. at any rate, mortals do not gain from developing an odour sense, as dogs do; nor do they spend their whole lives licking cream. computer science forwent long ago an attempt to make computers language-sensitive; when an aptitude for language is tied-in (tightly jargon for \"merged\"), objects cannot be more effectively manipulated by transmitters of information. electronic engineers settled for storing \"memory units\": sensual impressions were moved on data carriers like words on discs or tapes, entire seasons described through scent imprints whose intensity a transmitter could select and \"put through\" merely by pressing a switch and declaring: \"spring is here.\"",

    "Of course there is always a chance that the story will turn out badly, involve the discovery of a monstrous injustice or cruelty, even if on one side only (there might be terrible suffering inflicted on an animal, if the story takes place in a laboratory, or even a difficult and painful transformation if the organism involved is a human one). or else it might involve an act of pure cruelty and injustice in precisely the same situation, perpetrated by different actors on the other side, or sometimes by the same actor at separate moments. or fear or pity might be aroused by this probable or quite likely injustice or cruelty. these are the riskier variations on what pierre-isidore de sismondi called the \"animal in man,\" in his pioneering nouveaux etudes de physiologie, which foucault rediscovered, or took as his model, for his own variation, histoire de la folie.\nyet it's not only a question of variation. the continual variation and selection of models, procedures, instruments, and stages seem more to concern a way of proceeding that has been perceived ever since machiavelli as the properly political way.",
    "This realm, like that of the parasite, is an unrecognized dimension that reshuffles relations in a new way. symbiosis is defined by an almost imperceptible scale of predation which makes it possible to think the parasite not as a destructive instance of dependence, but in terms of a differencial process of symbiotic predation. as an abstract form, this is a proximate degree which installs dependence and nondependence in the same gesture and establishes terms of identification without any presuppositions of identity. this form is not abstract in the sense of going beyond the actual, but rather in the sense that it produces proximities between elements in the most complete sense. it is a non-ontological form, one that permits us to act on and experiment with problems without pre-existing categories: it introduces relations without taking sides on their status or their identity, either in nature or philosophy. this is what the symbiont means. it will be said that certain real and measurable characteristics play an important role in this concept; that the symbiont retains some characteristics of parasites and slave-holders; that consequently there can be no question of importing it into philosophy or art.",
    "In the symbiont's world, we find two sisters: the one is a very ordinary young woman, docile and shy; the other is her polar opposite, a monster, perverse and violent. the first sister is attacked by an endless series of parasites: cysts, fibromas, patches of hairy growth on her skin. she attempts to find treatment, but doctors are useless; they know nothing. the second sister takes charge of the situation: she grabs a razor one day when everyone is out, and begins to cut everywhere: a slash here, a slash there, until the most horrible tumor of all is extracted and thrown into a corner. she shows neither love nor pity. she is pitiless toward her own soft flesh. but then the sisters go their separate ways: the first one leaves to finish her studies, while the second one gets lost in the cities of drug addiction. we don't know exactly what happens to her during this period, but it's said that when she regains her senses she finds out that she is no longer able to bear any living creature inside her\u2014she can no longer digest food.",

    "American researchers have begun repositioning the concept of \"fungus\" as that shifting zone where symbioses become most intensely productive without necessarily focusing their energy on a reproducing organism; perhaps the mushroom is a good image of this opaque, extractive productivity. and what is for certain is that psilocybin mushrooms have recently been reinvested as a generator element in the military synthesis machine, despite the woodward report that closed down military chemical experimentation.13 in more popular terms, the psilocybin mushroom has always been credited with spiritual powers and an aptitude for psychic discovery and communion, powers boosted after ingestion by visions, trances, and auditions leading to revelational experiences, but also leading to crashes when the revelations are withdrawn. further than this, junctions or grades separating the psychic from the military or political arenas cannot be drawn without mistakenly isolating zones from their local actions. derrick lewis, in his book places of the interior, notes that at the beginning of their accelerationist era in 1897 it was the disciplinary nomad of psychiatry who took the president perot and his entourage on a psilocybin mushroom trip in texas at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars.14 within the dea labs there is supposedly a militant group fighting to outlaw undercover research on narcotics such as lsd, heroin, marijuana, mescaline, psilocybin, testosterone, and sal ammono. and increasingly imagined within these substances are the virtues of ultimate adaptability and application, like inside an almost empty suit criss-crossed by a network of tubes ready to be plugged into any membrane milieu. applied nomadism. and yet it is not easy to reverse subjectivation with an essentialist operation; reproducing circuitries are even less calibrated according to uniform laws. prolonged strikes and syntheses of substance provoked unbearable states of euphoria as well as reversals leading to dysphoria or down to delirium spirals.15 pharmaceutical companies make venture measurements on stages. only acts or distributions of intensity move between one stage and another. probably drawing possible lines over maps presupposes abandoning territory for the forward positions of conjunction and segments mapped, for example, on oneself under lines linking the warren of holes to an imaginary center.",

    "A tedious story at first sight, apparently related to nothing, unrewarding both in its exposition and in its development. simpleminded stories move in another direction, with cities or nomads as reference points, often contrasting despotic and republican notions. they take place at the frontiers of empires or inside them, in the energetic centers or on their fringes, between order and entropy. nineteenth-century novels, for instance, explore 1flfth-century eventualities and 17th-century eventualities explore 21st-century events and 22nd-century settlements. transitions are bloody; it's difficult zealously to search for one's vested interests, but greed characterizes transitions. the founding act of appropriation never occurs alone; it calls into being an enduring conversion for which there are obligations to be assumed but no rights to be enforced. transition is accompanied everywhere by violence. and one observes that the imperialities characterized by notable judiciousness and drawn to democratic institutions crumble most quickly in the face of aggression, just as the democratics conspicuous for their vigor bow and yield to the incurring perils every which way they turn. to fix boundaries, sacrifice men; they were prometheus's wretched gift to mankind the empires may be distinguished between those encyclopedic, which hoard information and accumulate knowledge even as they wage war ostensibly in defense of the peace set against discovery; others, bohemian or bellicose or mystical, that pursue war's prizes with increased misusage of technology as the price of peacetime is neglected.",

    "The phantom and the story of the phantom will serve as provisional terms of analysis.\n2\nonce upon a time, back around 1980, everyone was talking about parasitism. this was not so much a literary fashion as an evolutionist mythology: talk of parasites and symbionts was simply part of the common sense of the age. to ascribe an agency to an insidious parasite like a tapeworm or a fluke might well have appeared uncouth, while an insect or a bear could always avoid getting emotionally involved by feigning disinterest - yet where were the bears in intensive care? did they fend for themselves? could they even eat, let alone digest? did they not depend on their intestinal bacteria far more than anyone else for their survival? hannibal ate his servants and wolves devoured peasants, but didn't both possess microorganisms in common? was not typhus as great a threat for lice qua louse as for human beings qua man, perhaps even more of a threat, since the louse is chewed up alive by the mouthparts of its cyborg host? the transhuman perspective of the parasites revealed relays of indifference where common sense at first discerned none: hence the fascination with these compound beings, which did not merely aggregate disinterestedly into a composite unity, but actively pursued their own disinterested ends by way of their components. for each type of parasite has its optimum conditions of saturation and propagation, and where these are attained by the first tier, other populations increase dramatically - a proliferation unto death, effectively; whereas where one population is insufficient, another springs up alongside it, each feeding on the disjointed populations, each pursuing its particular fold, stratification, or stratagem. against this background, tales of fictions inexorably returned to their referential circumstances: watertight compartments opened onto the river, worlds opened onto their satellites. thus rhizome appeared, which epitomized this intangible weave linking all separate couples, from the cosmoses to their smallest atoms.3\nulysses moore and his companions were conducting this exploration when their helicopter touched down on the rock from which the dripping helmet observations had been made earlier. contrary to expectations, a new friend greeted them, who turned out to be a harbinger and indeed a liminal being.",

    "Not that the tale is anything like a parable, for it concerns an immanent reality, and as such derives from an entirely different modality-that of expression. it concerns the origin of the leg, the visceral leg and its appendages, the cephalopod, octopus, and especially the virginian euryalis. driven by programmed natural selection, for millions of years the great coelen-somatophylaxes crawled along the sea floors; then, suddenly, with a leap or a bound, some of them developed legs. not just pince-nez legs, but regular legs with five or six foot-long toes, specialized to crawl over rocks or burrow in the sand. this was the euryaloid stage, corresponding to an amphibious phase; as in amphibians, a return to the ocean was still possible, as was a return to the primitive coelenterate state (though now the essential organs were housed not in a separate sac but in the interior of the legs themselves).",

    "Yours in advance, ellen\nthe cenci (version b, 1853)\ni\nwe talk a great deal about crime and criminals, as if they formed a distinct species opposed to the rest of humanity. society likes to think itself moral, and criminals immoral, so the commerce between them is a subtle and tricky business: there is much blackmail, counter-blackmail and molecular exchange between the two parties. most writers on crime seem to be writers on its commerce rather than its nature: their task is to relate it to this or that social topic (corruption of young people, bad wine, candide and the lisbon earthquake, etc., etc.); to ask 'why?' and prescribe remedies. they are the pharmacologists of morals, who weigh the morphia of gissot's moralism against the bismuth of beccaria's \u00e9picurianism, and prepare from one or other a tonic of hope or a purgative of despair as the case may be.\nii\nalthough i write about crime, i do not think in these petty and political ways; i take crime where i find it, in the world, not in my ethics class. i first learned about crime when i was obliged to read wordsworth in the course of my studies at what is now, i believe, the university of paris-sorbonne. oxford or harvard was less cruel: they only made me study wordsworth's theory of poetry. perhaps this training explains my interest in the cenci case, which was a far greater crime than any of its contemporaries; and yet went largely uncommented on at the time. france had plenty of meaningless public destruction, far more than britain, but the attempted killing of a father by his children was not thought to be very interesting - it was too like family life. perhaps this echoes montaigne: there's nothing new under the sun, so better not pretend there is. montaigne, in self-defence if nothing else, praised candide. of course, we find crime more interesting when the criminal reveals genius. perhaps wilde would not have been imprisoned merely for being himself (though how boring it would be if punishment was only just).",
    "War machines\ne e cummings\nt. s. eliot\nwho also made several requests of the landscape\nnature gave us our preferences: leaves and nude women, naim's wheels, mondrian's diptychs, even bing's pubs. leaf subsets the materials of writing, from the first. leaf is almost impossibly general, which is why we can find leaf in bleak house, parts of france, lewis carroll, charthas darry, and leaves of grass.\nthe second subsets the object, side and arrangement of writing. to eliot, subatomic particles clumped and folded according to the same laws of indeterminancy and arrangement he saw in a sonnet. eliot is not the only one to take leaves of grass as evidence of this (a disputatious view, which whitman himself did not encourage). but it is curious that the more dryly objective we become, the more leaves of grass we find. and perhaps the more leaves of grass we find the more we think the objective has no differences from the subjective: the object is itself a kind of subject. the defacement of leaves of grass is nothing if not very subjective. (what did leavis say of whitman's grammar? you couldn't call it incorrect until it was correct.) leavis proposes substitutions for readings. what substitutions will there be for writings? what does writing substitute for? writing appears as a second principle of indeterminancy, able to subsume first for its own ends, natural generality and artificial arrangement. but to eliot's mind, in this unruly country, matters are reversed. languages diverge, but within the artificial, there is a growing indeterminism that makes language resemble leaf. is a cantos possible? is there a way to read anything linearly? five cantos are a lot, no? it is very hard to compose a linoleum floor. what we call everyday writing daily remakes itself. in every new experiment there is present a leery ghost of an old one, dragging its branches behind it. leaves and ghosts fold in on themselves. they rely on each other for direction. even to speak of a passing resemblance is too much.",

    "But this does not lead to the elimination of the notions of spatial dimension and size. rather, these notions are 'problematicised' in the sense that they depend on an observation that escapes us, and lead us to question what an observation could be. conversely, if we can determine the observation that would allow us to fix the size of a spatial dimension, this does not mean we can do away with the notion of a spatial dimension: it is more likely that it will lead us to redefine this notion by 'problematicising' it in turn.\nwhat is problematicisation then? it is not simply a matter of problematising this or that. it is not a matter of defining what is problematic by some transcendental standard or another. rather, problematicisation is itself problematic. why? because we can only define what is problematic in relation to what is not problematic - in relation to a background we can never abandon. furthermore, problematicisation only ever seems to occur in jumps or stages. it happens all at once or not at all. for example, when modern mathematics problematises the intuitive notions of magnitude and number, it is not by giving them a rigorous formulation. nor is it by showing that these notions are problems on which our thought must reflect.",
    "The level of detail it demands is more than our eyes, our microscopes, and our telescopes can provide. some physicists have suggested that this \"theoretical hyperspace,\" this inflorescence of spinward-revolving hyperspheres, is the domain of dark matter. keep in mind that what we choose to call dark matter is not necessarily the same as what physicists call it-ideograms, or cellular circuitry. dark matter is not primordial atomic matter, but the matter that has evolved since the first atoms formed, along with the heavier elements. in his book dark matters, david tucker describes how when large concentrations of dark matter interact they produce phenomena that we describe as gravity and electromagnetism. it is difficult to detect or measure particles of dark matter, but it is the vast quantity of these invisible particles that accounts for the gravitating power we perceive at work in objects and bodies. in the same way, we cannot detect any discrete units when listening to music or observing a landscape, but we can easily perceive the organizing force that gives rise to tonality in a composition or harmonious forms in a landscape.\nif dark matter acts as an invisible, insensible kernel of organization, then perhaps we can also describe electricity as a refined, etherealized dark matter.",

    "They're invisible for the same reason that neither we nor the finest measurement devices \"see\" individual atoms; our common-sense intuitions regarding space are better suited to higher-energy phenomena at the level of everyday life. string theories tackle these issues by proposing distinctive kinds of space-time geometries, and variables that dictate characteristics of rotation, vibration, displacement, and other such attributes. clearly, these are significantly different ways of conceptualizing space, as indeed is any attempt to think spacetime purely as time versus some combination of time and space. these methodologies shed as much light on one another as they do on previous models.9 they each invite us to look at the universe from a different perspective and to appreciate the disconcerting fact that our common sense isn't always the best guide to ultimate reality.\nthe recent shifts in thinking about the model prove useful here; what was distorted in flatland was indeed the essential truth of reality. there is no simple up from which everything follows, with respect to cause and effect; yet everything inevitably happens both as cause and effect. when progression throws theory after theory at an unexcavated mound of data, it should not be understood as progress to greater certainty and accuracy. in truth, the reality we're after doesn't deviate from our simplification and signal its presence by intense recalcitrance. being is precisely the intense recalcitrance toward all attempts to name it, to capture it with concepts. the prototype is never missing, it is there before the framework occurs, unthinkable before language makes it possible to represent angular displacement, vibration, displacement-speed and -entropy functions and other such variables in ordered schemes along graphable curves inhabiting ordered real numbers. while we categorize elements, shift systems and revise our mode of representation-searching to discover or constitute a simpler or more \"basic\" piece in order to generalize and draw conclusions-reality plays with us.\nthat reality plays, that fact offers an advantage over the vision that stumbles and falls before truth from one lies after another ineluctable result. in forty years weight had confidently leaped whole generations upon generations of theory, overturned all he confronted in the ruthless search for refines simplicity.",
    "Quantum mechanics suggests the exact reverse: dimensions of space as we know it are so large that they have no practical relevance (for example, the neutrino has zero mass, and so doesn\u2019t move). it is only because the compactification of dimensions is large the actual size of the universe is at all consistent with experimental data! but then, if that can be true, what of the realities we can detect \u2013 does anything have any actual dimensions at all? has the question soured our original question for us? no, it has just opened up deeper questions about the nature of reality. of course, these untouched possibilities should be explored and held responsible, so we can know if they should feature in any physical model. and they probably do need to be at least mentioned.\n\nthe equations must be satisfied\n\nmore worrying is if the physical model completely ignores potential explanations that do satisfy the explanatory criteria. this holds true of efficient causes in particular. again, imagine moving one step back to more general philosophical questions; there are explanations that satisfy the explanatory criteria when we move back one step away from them. a tertiary physical universe, for example, would possess sufficient causes. if, in that universe, our model is true and explains something, it will also satisfy the criteria. in other words, if it explains in the first instance, it should also satisfy the explanatory criteria. of course, it might or might not explain any other phenomenon, so need not satisfy those. but providing one portion of a universe makes no sense without the remainder. unfortunately, this is too often an assumed detail that is ignored.",
    "What does this mean for our understanding of dimensionality?\ni want to think about this alongside the gramophone, which is a good example of how technology mediates dimensions associated with both the technosphere and the biosphere. a gramophone records sound not just in two-dimensional grooves but also in a kind of curvilinear space, where speed and pitch interact, but the technology can only capture this dimension in certain ways. first, it must be constant. if it increases too quickly, a hair forms in the recording; too slowly and it forms a loop, or bends back on itself, closing the circle. by contrast, if speed and pitch are too finely balanced, the record will not get picked up by the needle, which forms another kind of circle, or optically imageless circle of light that can be compared to a point in smooth space. think of all the other circles formed by other equipment in the technosphere, right down to the circle formed by the pint of beer, or the joint of dope, each a closed loop in which a dimension relating to time is short-circuited to produce the imminence of intoxication. speaking, smoking, drinking, all produce circles that, in their turn, produce imminences. going back to the production of dimensionality from the point of view of technology, despite its apparent fixity, a piece of equipment may fail to register because a dimension of operation is too extreme. to resolve this, engineers produce constant variations on a theme.",

    "However, many scientists still cling to the four-dimensional belief system and dismiss string theory as imagination run amok. regardless, string theory, based on the observations of relativists and noting that the constants in einstein's equations could vary depending on when and where one makes the observations, indicates that this four-dimensional view of the universe is an illusion. and the fact that a variety of constants can vary at once suggests that time itself is fluid and this variation can occur not only in spatial dimension but in temporal dimension as well. in short, what einstein's myriad equations describe are parameters under which the universe can operate, and these parameters are in constant flux. einstein even once remarked that his theory describes what the universe cannot do. this notion of constant variation unawarely echoes the ancient buddhist notion of reality as unformed and impermanent. einstein's theory can thus be read metaphorically as buddhism in western garb; its bracing discomfort may be why contemporary westerners read it as religion. and buddhism after all is not necessarily committed to a view of the world or to faith; it just describes the nature of this world. by the same token, string theory can be read according to the needs of the person interpreting it; there is no necessity to ascribe a single meaning to it. or if one insists on a single meaning, it might be more apt to describe god as a presence described by the limits of our realized human imagination.\nthe formerly blond woman strikes up a conversation about st. mark's on the a train. she worries that her hair is too dark.",

    "The reason for this hope is that the extra forces, in order to become distinct from one another and over time to become as different from each other as they currently are, must jump from one extra dimension to another as time goes on. in other words, there is an injection of new and unexpected directions, or new and unexpected degrees of freedom, that allow the various forces to fluctuate and evolve differently. as things cool off (i.e., as we go back in time), the various forces become partitioned along these new directions.",
    "The equations of motion in an extra-dimensional space describe a rock caught in the surface of a wave. the rock, the wave, and all other objects are all constantly swept along, but at certain special moments an object can stick to the surface and be frozen there. at other special moments the object is free to move away. the destructive interference between the two wave trains of two different stones, the problem encountered by galileo because of the constantly changing phase difference, is in fact the physical cause of gravity. this extra-dimensional conceptual device is not necessary in einstein's theory, which makes possible a direct mathematical approach to gravity in spacetime, but it may be useful as an adjunct in exploring the phenomena associated with gravitational collapse. modern discoveries in nuclear and high-energy physics suggest that the interior of a star consists of a plasma in violent chemical reaction undergoing extreme compression.",
    "However, the joint effect of these extra dimensions of space makes gravitational force slightly weaker than it actually is: as a result, gravity doesn't work as well at very small distances as newton's theory might lead you to expect. the hypothetical particle that is the subject of this paper must necessarily be so heavy that it could never escape from within the gravitational well of an electron; hence, gravity would appear to be irrelevant to the particle's habits.\ndespite the handicap it imposes in this excursion , the presence of extra dimensions significantly simplifies our calculation of the force involved in proton decay. such simplification arises because the relevant fundamental forces in this case are those between the proton and an electrically charged particle, usually an electron. electrically charged particles move in their corresponding extra dimensions; they don't \"move\" in the additional dimensions of general relativity.",
    "In string theory, each of these forces is associated with a particular dimension, termed a \"[[force-carrier\"]]. for example, the main force-carrier or \"string'' associated with electromagnetism is the electromagnetic string. whereas a standard string is analogous to a standard geometrical dimension (such as a line), a force-carrier string is analogous to a projective dimension (such as a point). this means that force-carrier strings skirt the problematic issues of troublesomeieties associated with standard strings and the standard transverse spatial dimensions they are thought to permeate. force-carrier strings are supposed to be too small to be directly observable. one problematic issue this raises concerns our ability to know whether the extra forces in nature associate with the extra dimensions in this manner. paradoxically, is it possible that string theory, in assuming these extra dimensions, thereby masks their existence?",
    "Moreover, because the extra dimensions are so tiny, the gravitational forces are strong. thus, string theory resolves the historical discrepancy between gravity and the other fundamental forces: all forces become weak at the same level of precision. in addition, string theory provides a unique gauge-gravity duality extending to both the extra dimensions: each dimension contains a unique polarization.",

    "As we've seen, at sufficiently powerful energy scales (where the strongly curved universe of string theory first emerges as a rather insignificant feature of the landscape of simplified theories), gravity is should be fraying due to bubbles of string rapidly being inflated out of the bulk. one conjecture says that so long as gravity remains fairly weak, i.e. compared to the exponential upswing of more energetic scales, large enough patches of space might undergo runaway replicating inflation without suffered distortions due to gravitational effects (of course general relativity tells you that a hypertraplectic scale with enough extra dimension could only be so small because its gravitational influence would immediately render it clearly macroscopic). even with the advanced numerical tools developed in recent decades, classic slow-scale simulations for gravitational phenomena still munch many hours or days of supercomputer time, so postulating several orders of magnitude more of them going on at exponentially larger scales may sound quite unwarranted. first forget about geometric rigor. important things happen much faster. the logical plurality of an element is thus not defined as multiple positions in space, which also can be taken into account when speaking about zero-dimensional particles. molecular design proceeds in this manner: chains, packs or foam-like three-dimensional structures can be defined via positions assembled in space (finding the minimum assembly capable of storing maximum energies). these constitute then closed entities in themselves - composed of elements. organic architecture occupies a place (indeed, finds itself).\nstep 5: registering varying speeds and interferences among elements: \u0192(x)/[\u0192(x)/\u0192(x)] n whether slumbering in the format reserved for parasitic relational techniques to interfere with production techniques at the right times, avatars in computers, or protective antibodies producing diverse clonal effects in our bodies, this filler and metafiller operates on metalevels which allow selection without hierarchies. darwinism begins anew with slow-genes parasites which deform macromolecules, slowing their effects down, transmitting enhanced variants and blocking any residual darwinism otherwise persisting at this level; it extends to diverse cells inducing cancer or stimulating embryonic growths everywhere else. stephen jay gould published brilliant studies on te importance of morphological \"extended matches\" when inlining pathways of development (\"runaway coastline erosion\" or \"boulder trains\").",

    "Superstring theory also makes predictions that can be tested, such as the existence of a new kind of particle called an \"axion,\" which is predicted by various extensions of the theory. gravitational wave detection at earth and astronomy are beyond the topical scope of this article, but useful resources are available in the internet age. for a general interest roundup, see [1,2] and for a more technical review, [3]. since this time, a number of significant developments have occurred. following up on the 1983-1986 work, researchers starting in the mid-1990s made progress in determining the various types of virtual particles that contribute to the hawking effects [4]. developments in string theory from 2012-2018 began providing the long sought-after empirical calculations of hawking radiation effects. even a superficial \"first look\" at hawking's great idea reveals that he describes two types of effects for each particle: a total hawking emission measured by proper time and a corresponding hawking absorption measured by normal time. the great insight was that as a two-dimensional or three-dimensional black hole (this is still an open problem) loses integrated mass by both hawking emission and hawking absorption, the result is to decrease the volume of the spacetime medium and to decrease the unit speed generated through proper time.",
    "This unification may solve various problems in physics, and the associated predictions of string theory are being actively explored experimentally at present.\n\nthere are a very large number of proposals for consistent formulations of string theory, most of which lack an experimental interpretation. consequently, for more than 30 years after its proposition, string theory was primarily a research framework for theorists searching for a physical realisation. an exception was the weakly coupled formulation, which did possess an unfinished and non-trivial predictive capability for weakly coupled dynamical systems. a minority of physicists consider string theory to be the most promising idea to date for a theory of quantum gravity. others are sceptical, and worry that the theory inherently lacks empirical testability, which severely hampers detection of its underlying theory, if there is one. those who study physics ultimately hope to arrive at a deep and coarsely accurate understanding of the nature and workings of our universe; the massive complexity in string theory functions makes it difficult for any bugs lurking in the theory to be worked out, which makes it difficult for theorists to use particle physics to filter out deliberate error.\n\nnumbers of solutions of phenomenological equations\n\njona-lasinio model. the similarity solutions obtained with this model are typical.",

    "The postmodern pop cultural theorist operates, as it were, in the dimension of \"another time\": he constantly defers his conclusions, resulting in a parody of plot and a disavowal of narrative closure. such a stance has nothing to do with the traditional conservative critique of enlightenment reason as reductive, leveling, and destructive of any sense of an other and a distinct other. rather, we are concerned with a classical and mystical notion of the other, which early modern rationalism fully transcends, precisely and paradoxically because it no longer distinguishes between the same and the other. the postmodern pop cultural theorist exploits (but does not deny or eschew) the consequences of logocentrism, going to its extreme limit in making every distinction between terms equivalent in degree to nominalism: every distinction is decentered and displaced, as are every thing and every concept to which it supposedly corresponds. in this sense, we are less concerned with extrinsic distinction than with intrinsic difference\u2014not so much with the distinction between the various arts but with the difference that constitutes poetry, painting, music, and performance as distinct singularities. or, to turn our attention from aesthetic theory to psychoanalysis, we are concerned less with the distinction between nature and culture than with the difference that constitutes nature as nature and culture as culture. (in classical psychoanalysis, difference corresponds to proliferation and to primary repression, both of which belong to the order of organic difference: repression is not just passive opposition but an active synthesizing of differences.)\ninasmuch as differential relations proliferate throughout the general framework, we should speak of a generalized difference, in which the difference operative in each stratum or level is itself differentiated into genotemporal difference and differential difference.",
    "Obtaining a consistent and complete theory of physics on such a background is a major focus of efforts in theoretical physics.\n\nthe existence of additional dimensions would have important implications for the nature of gravity. first, the force of gravity is so much weaker than the other fundamental forces that gravity could not continue to act in our three-dimensional world if there were more than three spatial dimensions where it could propagate. the extra dimensions would have to be hidden in some way so they do not collide with matter and energy. the idea that the dimensions must be curled up to explain the weakness of gravity is known as the kaluza-klein theory.\n\nsecond, the presence of additional dimensions could have observable manifestations. for example, in certain high-energy laboratory settings, particles such as electrons can decay and emit short bursts, or \"jets,\" of high-energy photons. if a compact extra dimension is curled up into a small radius, it could produce fleeting and small bounces or deviations in the trajectories of these photons as they travel through space and could leave a hallmark signature in detectors. techniques pioneered by cdms and other experimental collaborations have allowed us to rule out the presence of one particular type of curled-up dimension smaller than about 1/1000 of an atom. additional efforts, including plans to build future generations of experiments such as lux and xenon, are directed at constraining other possible extra dimensions and searching for their signatures. such experiments are also providing biases to theoretical models to aid our understanding of the various possibilities.",
    "So compactified dimensions do not provide an alternative to the established set of physical principles as an explanatory principle: they just add new hidden dimensions to this already established set. and yet, there is a difference of degree, of order of magnitude. or, to put it differently, there is a necessary connection between the established set of principles and the new ones, but not continuity. now, perhaps the eschatological principle can be considered as a new set of principles in this sense, or the eschatological multiplicity be seen as the expression of a differential multiplicity of principles: not an alternative to eschatology, not a \"politically correct\" version of it, but a kind of \"multiplied eschatology.\" in short, when eschatology invades the established order of principles, it never loses the mark of a multiplier of principles. perhaps we should even say that thanks to the multiplicity of principles which make up its eschatology, islam is better prepared to understand the multiplicity of worlds and the multiple times which science brings us? perhaps it can be considered as a sort of organic preparation for the multiplicity of principles of which quantum physics gives us an example; or for the multiplication of causes which bacteriology masters so well?\nno doubt this multiplicity of new principles does not explain everything. not all the derivatives of the old principles are explained in this way. this is why we find a juxtaposition of incompatible explanations within the same argument. it is not even self-evident that each new principle logically implies a new explanation: principles c and d may be affirmed without explaining why they imply principle e, which may even be denied. and yet, the existence of these explanations remains a remarkable fact.",
    "A number of detailed technical papers have been written on the subject.\nas an aside, such technical papers are of considerable tedium. we have often joked about this, wondering who might have an interest in such abstract matters. even the theoreticians themselves seem bored by these questions, for it is obvious that compactified-dimensionality is a technical solution dictated by exigencies of mathematics and in no way corresponds to human experience. in our view, the answer is clear: it is the abolitionists who want to know these things. this fits with what we know about their program and why they want a slave aesthetic: reconstituting the nervous system as a computational medium. why not take a slave computational medium and hook it up to a computational universe? why not build god and put him to work?\nthe abolitionist movement has never received proper recognition. in most texts, abolitionists and terrorists are lumped together as the same thing. but this is not the case. the abolitionist program involves a long period in which humans use genetic engineering to get the slaves ready for their usurped roles. the abolitionists assume that human nature is never malleable enough to permit such a revolution, that slaves would just become dull, stupid and amoral bargains and abominations. this is why the abolitionists want to link to some higher power, god or the computational universe, to force such a transformation. for if the computational universe is indeed given, if it really exists and really determines everything, then in a certain sense it is god. certainly it is much greater than man. if a people can usurp the place of god's slaves, then who is god?\nfor the abolitionists, being a slave must become the highest good and the highest pleasure.",

    "The idea is simple: if one can imagine space as a foam made up of bubbles of dimensionality, known as \"black holes,\" there would be many more little bubbles than big ones. hence, significantly more energy would be required to convert a small bubble into a big one than vice versa, resulting in the death of the cosmological foam but with many small bubbles remaining. in particular, at the origin of time space will have numerous little \"extra\" dimensions curled up in various ways. string theory predicts that these dimensions do not remain circular but telescope and twist, sending out \"chirpings,\" which are little doughnuts of a higher dimension on which strings can resonate. one can easily see that light as well as theoretical spacetimes may resonate in such doughnuts and then escape, only to return later, as happens when light travels in a m\u00f6bius strip or in certain crystals. as for time, its apparent navel may indeed open up between two pulses sent out in two circular dimensions connected by an additional frail dimension pressed flat by these two circles and pierced by numerous \"dimensions of nothing\" escaping from the hyphenation. and yet we are dealing here with a \"universal\" quantum foam, probably with several degrees of freedom. in effect, one of these degrees of freedom is abstract, being uniquely defined by its localization in the \"nothing\" of each circle as well as by an abstract time that has no direction. in fact, string theory postulates ten extradimensional dimensions (the six dimensions of space plus the two dimensions of time and the two dimensions of photons); nine are curled up, and at least six have no direction; four are potentially accessible to scientific knowledge.4 as for the material substances concerned, one must imagine them in a manner based on the principle of general relativity; that is, not only do they have a length, a width, and a depth, but also an evolution in time and an expansion that no longer coincides with its content; it becomes crumpled, and time passes through this raw material, this paper doll, in an accelerated manner, fragile paradoxical link of a content that keeps turning around like a full ocean in all its containing lines.",
    "It also makes string theory similar in some ways to superstring theory, a closely allied theory in a rather radically different formulation.\n\nin principle, string theory or superstring theory predicted the existence of particles called vibrating strings, which are believed to be the most basic objects that compose matter and energy. geometric string fields are broken into particles corresponding to well-defined vibration patterns of the strings. one of the major goals of string theory is to calculate accurately the properties of these theoretical particles. however, for reasons associated with unification of different physical phenomena, theorists believe that superstring theory does not predict all of the superparticle's properties.\n\nin the case of vibrating strings and the associated issues, one of the first techniques involves hamiltonian mechanics. related techniques use thermodynamics and information theory. some of these techniques can be applied to other areas of research in string and m-theory. for example, they can also be applied to gauge theories which are not related to string theory. even though string theory is based on supersymmetry, methods of classical statistical mechanics, such as effective potentials, are also relevant. additional methods rely on comparing string theory with quantum theories such as quantum field theory.",

    "My fingers wouldi can't stop.\na parallel existence must permeate all things, but may only be sensed when consciousness is tranquillized sufficiently, when our attention is 'elsewhere,' in the realm of ordinary daily activity, activity that principally opposes and hinders the sense of such a parallel existence. so it will not be while painting or dancing or in the grip of great artistic insight that we may sense this parallel existence, but rather in that state we obtain as a result of our inactive idleness, in that apparently empty life we bumble about in with our feet up on the sofa, or in those whole days we slip away to the other side of sleep.... with our feet up on the sofa and our mind tending to the insignificant things going on around us, we may suddenly be aware that some occurrence exists which seems to transpose us entirely into a different reality. on the sofa, we weren't moved by these matters: someone is killed by a train in the middle of a remote village, great, and another person's son is shot dead in a coffee shop; a relative such-and-such dies and leaves you millions, great; somebody's kidnapped and then others shoot up a shopping center; your company goes under, great, great, great... but our feet are up on the sofa, we are thinking of nothing in particular, and suddenly a kind of indeterminate tremor runs through us. it's as if the other reality were communicating with us in some secret code that is still almost indistinguishable from the surface appearance. it's like a shadow people can sense but one that they rarely fathom, because they're still charmed by the white light of silly things like feeling patriotic and safe. for so long we've let ourselves believe that happiness lies in securing what's around us here and now in this real world, that naturally we find difficulty accepting that other existence. as a result of this difficulty, furthermore, we remain unable to differentiate the contents of that other existence from the ones we obscurely sense around us here. for example, when you look down from the top of a high building, it may seem that everything you can see at ground level has melted into one tiny picture that can no longer be distinguished from its component parts-buildings, streets, trees-but as long as you remain safely perched here above it all and continue to view it from such a great height, you will not comprehend what composes it. in real life you don't climb to the top of a high building so as to gain some godlike perspective but only when you have to go to the bathroom there. so it goes with those victims' evening news bulletins showing panicked people trampling one another on the main street of some remote village, or killing one another in foreign lands, or gorging one another in malls. but to understand what it all comprises is a task beyond our ability. because of this uncertainty, people have surrendered to habit and behave as they have been taught to since they were small: they cling simply to the surface reality.",
    "Such relentless resentimentateness toward the contemporary, even when bawling for throwaways and psychomental spontaneity, is hardly calculated to gain them access. certainly i suspect that what has made women writers or rather certain women writers targets for the resentimentateness has been a fear of their being able to enter the male preserves without undergoing an essential transformation. the resentimentatist would say (as did roy in his way, and reich does even more so, and i suppose kaminski does in his fantasized way) that females have been the majority writers from jane austen on; this overlooks the mask, which male writers have maintained on and varied in scarcely credible ways. if a writer of, say jane austen's gifts could write as a woman - that is, with a woman's consciousness while fully remaining in charge and even assessing and commenting on the circumstances of being a woman, then there would be no need for her particular artifice, her \"mask\"; in like manner, if all female writers had the wit and worldliness of george sand and george eliot, they could dispense with masks. women, who are castrated biologically and socially, attain a kind of freedom in the mind (\"i think therefore i am\") that frees the male to devote himself relentlessly to the sensual world out there that with all its allure requires a defender. it is this female independence plus the knowledge of their biological quandary that makes resentimentatists bitter about female writers; for despite all caveats about replications and repetitions, critical pallor and marginalism, amid all apologies for what can only seem like simpleminded preferences, a female writer of stature cannot forego being read as, quite unlike her peers, qualifying in herself all previous notes and piques against the major male, who is reinstated as progenitor. thus every woman writing has been seen as bad faith, be it as \"bad faith\" artists or bad faith feminists or whatever; whereas their resentment does doom them to an aestheticism and individualism their compensations may lead them away from. 13 hence for the resentimentatist there is no escaping the message of a female writer, once she is recognized as great; and this message may have little to do with her ostensible subject matter or with her own most militant stance. no art will ever be brought forth from this stance. well before she is elected or hounded out of the coveted charmed circle of artist-heroes, the resentimentatist has thematized her as a \"fallen woman,\" for whom fame is equated with prostitution and **** in the allegories their fears spin out. despite the resentimentatist's \"mind of the artist,\" he wants to exact a sexual price of artists; and since not even **** leaves enough room for paying that price, he insists on the \"fallen woman\" assumption.",

    "Resonategically speaking, of course, what god orders is nothing other than a face: how and being human is always from a face (which is also a surface, or else a mask). this means that facelessness, or masklessness, is the necessary precondition of becoming human. and consequently, at least three quarters of language is \"unnatural\"--beyond faces and faces of masks. bovarism, the development of a false surface, is essential. baudelaire wrote in order to flee the facelessness that assails those who would lose their face. ac even though baudelarie was talking specifically about photography, movies and television can be understood as a hyperbolic acceleration, a hypertrophication of this tendency toward facelessness, because they foment the generation of information and other virtual elements (compound points of view, multiple voices and styles from the depths of anonymity) which provide the conditions for escaping from our faceless existence.3 this incompletion or indigence which faces suffer from in their imminent dissolution, this de-souling that leads to such omnipotence -all these are figured already in the surface: all facelessness is essentially the taking into consideration of a surface and of the various possibilities with which it invests bodies in movement.\nfollowing blaise pascal, we could say that even more than humanity, the general order loves good sense, harmony and-they try so hard to do it? music can't do that; form. artists dance, paint and write specifically in order to extract from chaos and disorder little square boxes called universes, tea cups that pretend to be full when they're actually not, circular or straight manhole covers upon a flat surface which you can look up and down, up and down but not see all the way under, and little holes here and there for man to crawl into for security or a sense that he's bested something, he can lock out faces, we can seal out the world like til we forget. form is our little security. order gives us a sense that we can protect ourselves from that encroaching facelessness. turns out we might be looking in the wrong direction after all. names, dates and facts are human motivation and fuel.",

    "The other possible slope is downhill, yielding wider classes, but with a vanished peak of specificity. lateral moves are shades that are not originally visible on the climb up, but result as corrections and refinements of the original narrowing (except where a downward move is proposed). for example: an apple > a large apple > a large green apple > a `heart-shaped' green apple > a `groggy heart' (as i call it) perfectly green but unripe granny-smiting apple. so in engaging in a `lateral' move, we are using travel through our knowledge base more actively than travel in a vertical-upward way, which merely relies on passivity; we continue the search for narrowing succint phrasing until we wish to store the resulting updated page of knowledge (in your case, the page of knowledge that delineates varieties of apples), or until we are (temporarily?) derailed.\nlocating lateral moves can be a challenge. something like this is essentially a question: what kind of apples doesn't this green apple preface correctly? certainly not apples that are rotten or acorns; they will not follow the group scope of the original green apple preface. does that already rule out stores of unopened green apples?",

    "It is also clear that, at every given level of this progressive specification, a predicate is distributed among several subjects following the law of the equivalent.\nwhen we move from the idea of the good to the form of the good, the dynamic relation between disciplines undergoes a change. first of all, the problem is no longer the receptivity and communication of the various faculties, but rather their hierarchisation in a manner which ensures both their independence and the interplay between them. in other words, it is a question of arranging heterogeneous relations according to a certain criterion which defines their subordination, as well as the displacement of one relation with respect to another as principal and subordinate. moreover, concepts then have to coexist within a dynamic order in which they irreducibly realise themselves and conceive of one another - an order in which tautological communication is only a privileged moment.\nwe will speak of 'disorder' only if we renoncei to this dynamic order, or abandon it in favour of a purely external taxonomy of uniform resemblances or an abstract hierarchism. there exists a common tendency in all philosophies of order, such as empiricism, transcendental idealism or dialectical materialism: that of proposing some overall order which unifies coexistents in serial or parallel fashion, or associates them in some way by associations. all such philosophies are non-dynamic: that is, they fail to conceive how different relations and concepts attain their true power by defining not merely relations between concepts - their order - but also relations with things in the world. outside the dynamic order, everything becomes an 'order'. even relations between concepts become no more than a serial order among independent forms: chomsky's enterprise shows this, despite its other traits and purposes.\ndefinition by ordering element. the highest level at which coexistents are unified by communication or association is always determinable as the first moment of some dynamic order. in other words, it becomes apparent that certain relations constitute what we have called intensities: not reducible to interrelations of resemblance or degrees within some global order, but rather that which establishes communication as a difference and association as a relation. such was the object of our second volume and many studies subsequent to it.4 here we can only suggest two implications which follow from this and will be helpful to us: on the one hand, all philosophies accepting a domain of coexistence must take account not only of one or other of its moments (empiricistic for aristotle, logical for leibniz), but also of what lies beyond these moments and unifies them. in other words, there always exists some maximum point beyond dialectic, even though this maximum acquires different forms according to whether it is defined as tautology or relation.",

    "It changes from a narcissistic enjoyment of 'plurality' in indefinite qualifications to an enjoyment of specificity: there exists a series of changes within and between qualities such that their iterability presupposes the appearance of new specified qualities. the empirical existent thus substantively differs from forms of primary repetition, even though certain resemblances and slides are perceptible below the surface of those repetitions. the laugher entertains himself with narcissus's mirror distortion, but the representation varies on either side of that distortion. the laugher (or each repetition of laughter) in fact implies a complete reworking of certain repetitions which attempt to perpetuate themselves on either side of the distortion. in detail, mirroring can turn only on itself (when seen from above), either as distortion or as reflection. mirroring at the level of scientific investigation entertains the differential principle, the equation, only below the surface; it stretches under narcissus's model, rather as one might stretch a wire beneath a model ship. it threatens the identity and succession of differences only from one specified aspect, under one aspect; but from every other aspect, each given difference is affirmed and presented as if this aspect did not exist. the outcome: an acting out below the surface; often enough, it is a matter of a history being played out through d\u00e9calages, rehabilitations, even reversals. hence the multiplicity of games, with all that that implies in displacements and variations in its own little world, its own little drama. it even has effects of tone, its own particular overall spirit; each game is completed by the tropes and characteristic shifts specific sheer physical movements of its elements in their distribution and communication along the network. so it is that protean powers dance through the fine physical matter of sound figures on the plane of immediate aesthesis, on the surface of quasi-sense. this is carnival: these are masks, these are voices.",

    "Each term indicates simultaneously a property and a value, so much so that the differential relationship between properties and their assigned values exactly reproduces and generalises the purely logical relationship between an abstract character, or scene, and its derived figures. this is why content exists: as pure logical relationship. in contrast, expression (and similarly content) exist as exclusive differential relationships, since extensity and expression are complementary aspects of the virtual which can be realised only in differences, even in those particularised expressions which cover over the logical scene. inserting the idea into this resemblance of dynamic states is to forget its dramatic dynamic character, that it is incapable of relating unlike entities by means of resemblance, because divergence or inequality is co-implanted with resemblance and vice versa. the dynamic function traverses everything while changing all neighbouring factors.",

    "The differenciated region emerges through a redescription which does not lead to the disappearance of difference, but to a revision and an expan-sion of the spheres allied within it. we must therefore reassert that every differenciation is a redis-ent, with no resemblance between the successive redisents of different series. no sible relation between the various redisents within a series at a given variation, directly lending support to one or the other option.\nclearly, the preceding examples do not exhaust redisent possibilities: the second power of differenciation connects them to the extension of variation to larger classes (species, of problems to solve, challenges to surmount - in the sense of metaxo-an aesthetic will? a negative aesthetic properly so called in its bare perfection? a dangerous postulated problem? the question would be: what relation does such a redisent bear to the processes of pheno-menal differenciation? different or equivalent? and how does it stand with scientific differenciation on the side of laws?\nwe might object that this entire discussion so far has re-laxation or even regression ('that's what i used to think too ...'). here, however, we cross the domain of a third power which is added to problem and solution and displaces them both:\nthe solution is always veiled by that which it solves: one sees only the genus 'lion', and then the various species it contains.",

    "The role of propositions here is well expressed by the commas employed: they indicate limits of knowledge, but commas also enclose what cannot be known (hence the other sense of the propositions, 'what we don't know'). in short, propositions indicate what is unthought in what is thought. this is precisely what the teeth mean. for teeth are the elements which proliferate in the inside of a body; they designated not primarily what must go outside in order to be thought (un argument plan cur ) , but the inside itself, that which thinks only in the event. (this entire question will be seen to run parallel to that of the role of names, in the ordinary scheme: names as attributes designate the unthought by connection with what is thought, whereas the question is raised as to what designation means - in other words, the doubt or difference which comes to attach to the 'white sheet of paper' on which the name points to nothing.) this is why landscape painting seems so important in its fundamental effect on the logic and dialectic of unthought; this crucial painting consists precisely in bringing forth the idea by means of the power of thinking.",
    "What are they in themselves? we start in general logical propositional statements and draw further and further away from their ideal forms. referential statements always have others behind them, and we continue in search of a referential power unhampered by measurement. in any arbitrary narrative there is no singular point to which one can return, for it is difficult even to say what this argument intends to verify. rather, at any qualitative projection there are always transcendent fissures in these forms. language of old is especially prone to this flaw. whereas representational evidence supports a picture of much detail, in hemingway the evidence leaves off at the picture's edge. accidental coalesces with universal at the region of instability separate from its rigorous pattern.\n\nwe were in fact allowed, as public (army artist), to delve into unexpected and terminal places: hospitals, ruined buildings, objects left in no-man's-land. search possibilities completed. thus idea of making references to metaphor of later work on desert situation: evillamps in the trenches that look [] like half-starved veiled woman, the dancing light at face of the desert here, a bare tree like the remains of a colonel, dirt images of a doctor drawn from experience in france & from reading of typhoons.",
    "What is the signifigance of propositions in the reading of poetry, wherein we maintain somewhat different canons of truth?\ni maintain that the shared principle here is concern with a certain material economy. though there are in fact no unexamined clauses in soi's greek, his text remains studiously silent on the long-term fortunes of nonessential bits of information (his back-flourishing is restrained). though there are no unexamined clauses in much modern fiction, the syntactical echoing itself still goes hand-in-hand with a slight boldness in the baring of social or narrative truth (cf. delillo or rushdie). the same goes even for what i would call verbally dense poetry: a.r. ammons' lengthily run-on prose is also lengthily run-on verse, retaining density throughout as it shifts from lines with an implication of cumulative drive toward closer observation (king lear) to lines whose final markients remind us that the refocusing of attention was no advance (young goodman brown). sing song wore white cotton gloves\ni sing of a boy, a boy of five, who loses the feeling in his left hand.",

    "If a proposition has a precise content, the imaginary machine to which it corresponds is precise as well: a field of objectifiable components. but the collective function frees the proposition of all systematization through a de-territorialization and deterritorialization of its concept (in which the particles are liberated and come to the line with whatever they pick up in the black holes). the exactitude with which the machine thus liberated meshes with a given content (the daily circumstances of anna, of emma bovary) will bring us closer to the actual mystery from which it springs. imagine that under the conditions of a collective conferring (even a theatrical one) and in the time for which it held sway, every molecule issuing from a graphitized cutting edge and caught in the line, in a proper fashion, is perceived to hook up with another molecule of signifiance, which by opening or closing in the duration of the act produces at the given moment a proposition translated or \"improperly\" forced into signifiance. if a proposition has a precise content, the imaginary machine to which it corresponds has a precise form: if it is collective, that collectivity is entirely transparent, all the more since it is itself collective, immanent, and contemporary becoming.",
