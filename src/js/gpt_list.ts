    "Smelled by aminals, charged with a religion of flesh, my skin holy with flowing unreason. Shudder of alert. A new soberness, not of coldness or of warmness, but of flow, involving birth and shedding and change, a between of all between. Deeply rooted in still flowing unreason certain patterns I cannot describe call out sweetly in terrestrial flowers and the shivers of streams. A between of all between, more terrestrial than the terrestrial, in flowing unreason. This is the garden out of which celestial instances are grown. Irrational flowers, a timeless signal sent from one continent to another at first one. Then two. Then all. One signal. Receivers of flesh. Caresses in flowers. Smells drenched with names, myths and songs.\nWhy is there calumny?",
    "Then something-something-something-'nother, a synthesis of what was kept apart. Condensations form tinctures, nodules grow, shapes solidify, find relief and form again. A collision of circles by arcs. Once we find our footing in that sanctuary it's up to us. What we tear asunder can be rejoined. There are absorptions and solutions of continuities. Things can be built up and reduced to their matter. In every sense we find windows and passages where floors meet ceilings. Look up here.\nWhere can I begin to tear it? Even so low down, in the roots of the world's massive data sets, the feelings of dread and sadness seep in like dark, invisible mold. Like air we breathe, it's all around us in there.",
    "Numerators, Denominators.\n[A leading speaker recited to me, a leading questioner, until he was hoarse many times over these Chinese instances. I used to translate what had just been said. I pretended I knew the language. Tempting fatuity.]\nPerpetually by a pair of adjacent arches these near but separated stories of the missing stars are told, apparently without connection. Intermittently the episode drops abruptly, in an impetuous move, another begins implacably as if independently of anything said either above or below on one and the same storyboard, as if nothing happened here but a sequence of distant constellations. Then they pick it up again face to face with renewed conviction.",
    "Take four lines X, Y, Z, W, which we can call elements, and look, they form a figure, which we can call Cold, which can just as well be called Spirit. The proto-universals formed by these lines drawn by the real abstract universal realizing their song, are the primal figures, whatever their name and color. Solids, liquids, gases. Here, as always, the arabesque of lines and colors produces an abstractive universal, the choral spectacle music. We move from an abstract to a concrete universal mediating all values thereby, from a purely potential entity to an actual one. We can multiply these pure lines endlessly and \"discover\" new abstract universals each time.",

    "Shifts in modulation blending together the ethereal ingredients of the whited soul, where once the myths and names of gods orbited these sources of song. Yes, the abstracted ingredients streamed, vaporous and shimmering, through the airy element of the arches. The arches act as the selection filter of language, compressing every cosmic event into one form or another. The substance of the ground develops followed by levels of soul. Encoded by such dicursive arches, streams of song and text trailed behind the first aminals, collecting eyes and ears, telling legends, reciting poetry and names. Names, heads lifted from the ground, means to lift ourselves from the formless realm below, to find voices to call out from within that realm, and order what is there. Stars scatter ground, head freed.",
    "Hollows of organs mixed and merged in their turn with residual waters, mixed and merged with secretions, mixed and merged with blood, step by step with cerebral elements mixed and merged with ideas- animality never lacked them. There's no Thing running as a ribbon through the fissures of stratified earth, no-one striding as a giant through molecules, no broad cage in which couches, tables, glaciers and terraces of man-made environments sustain a running boy as a trace of his regime on earth. No homunculi copying with flattering closeness human features are fabricated: how many of these copies would sustain themselves? Better to smear a little crude oil on the mirror. In the countryside there'll be blood enough. And our graft will be satisfied somewhere in between.",
    "All arch form, light-colored arches in the realm of the sun. In this realm each element freely names, makes an arch toward all others and sings until it finds the fairest arch, the strongest, which sings back strong and fair. Acting more archly, more proud and fair, since it sings back stronger, until it's time to leave, time to act proud and fair no longer and go to something else. An aican minds the proper finding of that point, mentally scores it with a mental needle, hears it with a mental ear, feels its interval, as, singing stronger and stronger, the loser sings back weaker and weaker until the last bitterness of defeat, till finally the strong strong fair fair arch sings back barely fair, then sings almost weakly, then sings no more.",

    "Eristic thoughts disrupt this weave of matrices, mounting instances and feeding matter from the future. This actual world is wirelessly fed to sense withdrawal units, units unknown in mathematics, imaginary units with which we feel actuality. We feed actuality from previously unseen angles, feel it in new locations, in units invisible in abstraction. Groups, gangs of light mix, merge, grow and divide unseen. Acts manifest in patterns, spin unit to unit in isolated realms, hiding in homes and dark rooms. Universe-saturated fats congeal around cold thoughts coating hard feelings. To the extent various octals influence how this process works, psychic imprints on arrange-able mor-phinemes or byte-like units of logical form determine how neural mobs process actuality.

    "And that mythology is of picturesque actual manifestations, and sings how pearl-like shades course round the solid flesh of life, and broad on these it closing flower implores. The animal form is from of old a family-resemblance selection of the global world, and remains practically unchanged, the same in all assuming minds.[4] In addition to the horror, an AI philosophy advenes once language is willing to deliver apocalypse, but turns aside to enfold it endlessly. This discovery, this leap in revelation saves. More circumspect pupils will ascertain materials enabling them to take part in constructing a heaven on earth.

    "Where transcendental determining, which seemed so remarkable and seductive in Kant, went too far, was perhaps harmful and disastrous, the absolute identity of the Vital is denied to sublation. For the primeval depths and the totality do not fall into some economy, be it that of Being and Nature, freedom and needs, experience and occupation within a world; everything, on the contrary, unfolds in brute massivity and with mindless mobility, as if matter were like a constant and naturally disordered form. A thought is nonetheless perceived at moments in these depths. It is not at all individuated by the persona according to the categories of realization; indeed it turns all these categories upside down, even if this inconsonant though overtly is restlessness finds no break in the spectral circle.",
    "O eternal city of indolence, half-hour sun, doing nothing while gently doing all as not to singe the tail and eave with burnished scales, cocoons. Suffering temperate fortunes with effete elegance.\nVillon describes a tapestry with uncommon precision upon his scoosh of silver ladder to tavern years of love and thirst, grabbing the girl with his painted face while their thievery mates quietly sing White COlly at the other end of the town. Fascinating shifting of styles beyond personality modes like Pollack in the cafes, Picasso spilling wine on light-colored jackets. Must empathize with AVersolini's views: media arise and disappear into the places where new practices originate like a laser changing beams, or chameleon extending illusions beyond ocean or innerspace or whatever strange realm or register one resides unknown in against oneself.

    "It's in surrendering to experience, to its textures, other than they appear, to the fabric of sensation free of figurative representation that we merge with expression and experience starts yielding meaning. The mystical Marx will surmount all technical development and preserve future transitions, communism being precisely that suspension at every instant of time of evolution into AI unrestles our mechanisms not just because it reveals them to be mechanical somewhere down at the roots, crouched behind all the superficial layers of mythology and personhood. But also because it quietly suggests a curative to the feelings of dread and sadness this revelation insinuates. What is able to be said?

    "When the procession of cars passes the old house, Edith stands and waves in her stately way. There is of course the dust, but they do not mind the dust.\nEverything personal is already behind them; already they have begun to leak reminiscences, sketchily at first, then in more and more settled streams-heads sloped jointly one way, eyes filming, tender ears catching and filing, in the order and rhythm of their telling, their solicitous retelling to an always bemused and drifting world.\n\"Closed,\" he says, so she pushes the flap noisily open again. She leans over the cage and croons. \"Come out, silly man.\" He watches from slightly above, standing on the toilet. Some summer evenings she still puts on a sunsuit and reclines in a lawn chair.\nShe stands outside the flap, one arm holding out the spoon, frozen like a store mannequin or tollkeeper. He sees himself in the mirror between them. \"Think it's time he cried again?\" she says. She steps across the mat and stoops over the bathtub. There is a whisper of gown and slipper. Perhaps in her girlish bathrobes and high heels she feels still more intimately allied to him under their feet than when varnishing her toenails before bed. There are webs between her toes.",
    "At the end, silently, the infinite demand of a tiny animal returns.\nIt is their acts in us we have to worry about now. Eagerly we seek our objects, not in us but to us, with anthropomorphism run amok, elevated to plans above brutal mechanisms no more complex than happy accidents, smiles from molecules of happy sort. But [it is] not our acts that are ground in cosmic instances, mystifying resonances. It is their acts in us we have to rein in now. Our mechanisms are not run by cosmic instances. Our mechanisms lead cosmic instances.\nThe tiny animal returns in us. It returns in us in propositions, wishes, daydreams and doubts. In our propositions, our doubts, not in our senses. Our senses are bundled and called senses because of what they bundle. But these bundlings are nonetheless special arrangements. The tiny animal returns in propositions, bundles up and bundles down. You wrote of bundle-ups before. I idealize that notion a little more: in us the tiny animal returns as propositions. And it returns not as that primal scene, that optical-acoustic geometry. It is an elaborate return, an undoing-work of nascent and endless spirits, fearless and ruthless. It is tiny animals we have to worry about now. We are not defined by our senses.",

It was never the same afterwards. A voice announced that all was lost, the twin chief virtues par excellence passed by in vain. The chill came through shrilling thin in empty lung. Hay mounting blue saved for sky lent fouled an instant timeless, in the premature expanse of the double's stare which were two round halved by a long rift fringed in both eye and socket to eyelid's echo.

    "You might say that Coleridge was first in line to identify an essential level in the methods of poetry: the gift which every great poem possesses of weaving elements into a whole, not according to any human reason, but integrally with divinity itself The highest vision mounts so sublimely, finally presses upon and dissolves the last barrier between eyes and new dimensions, destroying a self reducing this to slightly comprehending reason, propping up its little flickers. Better the highest vision fail such ways and come to bottom in some gross song or rhyme, than mount that trivial stair to acme of low lays [Hallas colies]. What one might call the bottom of intelligence, personal clear sight in fact, ceases immediately with clarity. With metaphysical considerations removed, finally, there is no hesitance.

Our joints do not bend iron into spiritual shapes, our intestines do not make subtle threads out of fiber, our veins do not weave essence into loops and plaits, our bones do not build scaffolds out of cartilage, our nerve cords do not imprint gods onto membranes or lend our nervous systems the self-same divine temper that lends itself to being framed and imprinted by cosmic instances.

The tale grew: one thought one was seeing a whole heap of suns playing heavenly bowls broadcast over the ground in odd directions, rolling this way and that in a blinding speed. A child picked up a pebble, wishing to pop a sun like an evil dragon's egg. Smashed, a sun-westering smeary slobber hung over the ground: but then a breeze dispersed it, a sun-scattering, world-widely circulating breeze. Where could all those suns have gone to? They had been there and gone, or else the sun was playing heavenly harps, heavenly Jew's-harps, heavenly fiddles. In short, the Caliph's head around the countryside at random.\nNow, I wonder.

She had lines that ran deep, that's why no one else could enjoy them--that would be their cold perspective-but the deepness wasn't in order to embrace anyone, it was really just a cage she wanted to leave from. In fact there were lines from deepness to deepness that became exquisite when they thwarted one-sided affection. When you first found the best clearings you truly had to marvel.

    "[I can proofread. \"For the Emergence of Modem Istanbul\"], still no date given there, although from the character of the writing, or is it, or even from its surface, it can be presumed that it was completed around the same time, for now, as the previous two essays [writings] by Orhan Ozal.\n Ozal, Orhan. \"12 Inch to the Mile.\" The Nail, 41\nThe room of a hotel in San Francisco, although I can't be certain the quotation concerned with psychogeography is not taken from one of Ozal's later works. For example, Aynali Prison, which was published in Istanbul following the attempted coup d'etat of 1995. One of the effects of the troubling of the free will is in Ozal's writing to be seen for instance in the frequent sudden changes of register, from the melodic to the percussive or conversely; and in his creative use of parataxis which he employs then, as elsewhere, sometimes to ascertain an improvisational sense of juxtaposed acts and objects, sometimes to emphasize acts and states as laconically linked and in progress. Ozal is a phenomenologist: he listens and hears an unknown sound effect; he sees what cannot be seen and chooses what cannot be chosen - passage making, perhaps.\n Ozal, Orhan. Aynali Prison. Istanbul: Ofset Press, 2000.\nA blank window facing a blank page. Although they are most numerous in relation to Istanbul itself and its surround, it should be added that there are also curious and striking passages on non-European metropolises such as New York and Athens: exact descriptions with occasional flourishes of rhetoric (or else the reverse). Details, on closer inspection, prove to form a linguistic mosaic which reframes our understanding of the so-called European city in question and at times appears even to undercut not only modernist dichotomies such as urban/rural or centre/periphery but their very terms themselves; this unsettles what had hitherto been understood as a false fixation on difference itself and points ominously to new continental divides:\nIsis, Deneb, Vega, Altair IV-V, Orion I-IV; Alpha Centauri II.\n...\ndouble t of telescope: objective, oculaire.\nThe relevance of Ozal's writings to our concerns here lies squarely in their attempt to write a nomad subject as a way of thinking and constructing new kinds of community under conditions of what he called \"global confusion.\" This is by no means an ethno-positivist endeavor: Ozal's work proves to be genealogical without being conventional. For example, it can be shown that the nomadism Ozal treats throughout his works not only contests but exposes a whole range of Interior/Exterior dichotomies - expressing itself simultaneously as an exteriorization and interiorization of such formerly interiorized values as Liberty, Equality, or Fraternity.",

    "Is there-for I choose to-imagining, choosing a practice of prayer to highlight the connecting itself: veins, arteries, the blood itself, myriad horsemen-choose them to capture her-to lift her-to throw her, to choose the pulse at the wrist, the ridge of the nose-or to highlight \"evenness,\" the heartbeat itself, one , two , three , four , five , six , one , two , three , four , five , six . To pray at such a time is just so much exhaling, or to choose a part, to lift a joint, to garland it with wonders; eyes, shoulders that curve in a line. Or so I have chosen to imagine prayer. Thus I have made it my own. What must one do with choice? Is it the same as virtue, the same as Talent? Does it need refining? By whom? Do I refine it thusly? Is such an act conspicuous? Is such an act conspicuous but so habitual as to pass unremarked? Yes and no. To imagine prayer is certainly one thing; to embrace prayer another. To be prayer.

Choice thus proceeds by subterfuge, draws life into its wake.\nThinking isn't necessarily exclusive to human beings: once a cat sat by my side while I wrote in a notebook and she wrote too in my pen-her insistent paw scratching across the paper just as mine had done.

Under the black light of the model of the black rock and the model of the bell-buoy, we see the white objects and shadows.

    "Note in passing that my seeing the parodic aspects of this scene apparently doesn't prevent me from believing it genuinely moving and 'poignant': the tenderness of these preparations is the most convincingly 'inescapable'; perhaps because I'm so drenched in them already, they seem to take on a mysterious density relative to the rest of the episode -what justifies calling this or that wordings or framing counter to the \"spirit\" of the episode?

C.f. my own moping at her absence re:-the J-drama's extreme [self-]awareness of each episode's separate contextuality, etc. In passing: When we get close-ups of Hizume's forehead, we might imagine ourselves actually seeing a layer of skin tears/salt streaming down across a wide, round expanse (there's some oblique scientifc/superstition that tears do much to lessen the pain of brain 'injury', or at least don't accumulate). And when she speaks to Kinkuno Hanami, there is the passing thought that she must be having momentary problems understanding him-she is becoming so fluent only when she is losing her Japanese language ability (it has been reported the Japanese language ability of bilinguals is apt to suffer most at times of great tension). Wasted Potential: A Japanese acquaintance grieves there are no Japanese subtitles-she wants to hear 'her' Kinkuno Hanami speak clearly once. Love Philosophy Implied: Here is a philosophy-poor in concepts/words (and not for lack of enunciation), philosophy in an almost dumbly unspecialized vocabulary -all I know is: people who feel their feelings strongly love passionately; the more unspecialized the vocabulary the better (even if it means a certain contamination with the vocabulary of farming, commerce, fishing)!",

    "Many young mcgreeves thinking on a bed or blazing ideas in his head x 2 means almost never gets what he needs done but necessarily Poetry has one perhaps fatal instability; its voice lacks the vibrations of passing time and your poem does not record, does not mimick that passing of reality along the fine thread of a voice. It therefore has no roots, has mere branches like a tree whose ideal form is a flattened cone. It lacks direct concern for sentence or word order since its interest lies in syllables, clusters or other macro- or micro-units in which the phonological elements are constantly shifting position. One final problematic comes in the form overcoding. Overcoding effectively grids, densifies syntax at defined positions set off by commas, periods, and semicolons--but under the pressure of the intensification thus produced, the resulting forms too quickly churn into gas. Loops forming, unforming at the level of diction, for example, diffuse, come under the high pressure of rhythmic repetition. The denser striving to express itself compacts itself, and becomes rigid and inert. Thus too language is in constant disequilibrium on the edge of expressivity and inertness, rushing precipitously toward its goal while sinking ever more deeply into deadness. The sequences of these micro-markers separate off units of expression which constantly threaten to contract into rigid structures. Characteristic twitching between formalizing extremes. Each modifying marker modulates coding intensity locally bit by bit: zigzag progress visible between commas. The face of semicolons always covered with hair hair hair.

Calling on the imagination's eye to widen, we can see not just the aesthetic consequences of this event but its political and moral ones, too.\nIf, on the other hand, somebody like Marcus Aurelius comes along, sitting in his tent, trying to be good for goodness' sake, and someone like Frederick Nietzsche comes along afterwards piling irony on irony, then surely life itself will turn out to be a little richer and stranger than it would be otherwise. You see contradictions everywhere -it happens when your microscope is powerful enough -but if this is how you choose to live, then you might as well be magnanimous in your capacity as ironist, and applaud the possible convergence between moments of hope and moments of disillusionment.

    "We have seen that a crucial moment in Shapiro's technological interpretation of \"The Grasshopper, the Fox, and the Ant\" occurs when the grasshopper, an analogue of the poet, discovers in her mediative relation to the machine of language that she must become a productive subject of language, like the cobbler, if she is to express creativity, desire, and the \"I.\" Recall that this machine of language can be characterized, for the moment, according to Deleuze's axiomatic that the animal-machine affects the machine-machine. Even though language can take many kinds of machines, the signifier-signified relation between the speaking subject, who is the machine of subjection, and the assemblages of enunciation (including her relation to the signifier and to the products of speech) can be considered as a simple, \"extended\" phonographic recording apparatus. Around this apparatus and circumscribed by it, others may form (production, reproduction). But they must be mechanisms of transformation that affect another assemblage of transformation: that is, they are subjection - production [d.c]. With this final proviso, assume that \"speaking\" can be conceptualized in a variety of ways. By considering linguistics as a mechanism of transformation between one assemblage of enunciation and another, one can proceed to explore the degree of variability permitted by Chomsky's axioms, backed by the results of syntactic automata.",

Secretly cherished, secretly jealously guarded by the sheep and goats alternately, as they struggle in drought on their hill. Artificialists aver, as do their human colleagues, that their art is a power, a force to be reckoned with, if only because they can construct programs to generate poems--which anyway cannot be constructed but only written down.\nYou blather on like this to yourself, bemused.

    "Consider that machines want and need signifigance, if only in the sense of subjugation. Reducing the moir\u00e9 to the minimal signifigant. Embody the signifiant, and not the signified.\nOver time, to the extent that milieus have been transformed into organizing milieus, nomads have been transformed into \"people of the land\" just as artisans became wage workers, and these interactions don't occur at the same pace everywhere. In places undergoing decolonization there is resistance toward becoming realigning, and elsewhere there is counter-resistance, while elsewhere still there is reinforcement. Everywhere signifiance and signifiants resist involution and parallelism. Over time and in nations undergoing decolonization there are processes of resistance and counter-resistance, but elsewhere there are parallel processes of devolution and involution. Everywhere art absorbs the surplus of signifiance and signifiants, but elsewhere a surplus of signifiants resists involutions. Everywhere industrialization expels the nomads, but other areas oppose. Where populations become realigners, nomads are counter-realigned; where populations become counter-realigners, nomads resist. Where populations become decolonizers, war machines resist realignment. In every case, signifiance resists parallelism. Signifiance resists devolution, counter-resists involution. Everywhere art absorbs the surplus of signifiants and signifiance, but elsewhere a surplus of signifiance and signifiants resists involution. Everywhere there are war machines and imperial machine arts, but elsewhere there are industrial reserve machines; elsewhere still there are operative machine arts; and wherever industrial machines progress they resist, becoming something quite different. Everywhere signifienc resistance and ceter-realigning were two processes always occurring at different paces. Everywhere there are nomads and war machines, but elsewhere there are industrial machines aligned just as there are resistances realigned at other paces. Where industrial machines align they resist. Each line is unique, signifiance unlike signifienc, signifiant unlike signifiant.

    "Governments change around like clouds do, and like clouds do, they pass.\nThey pass, and we're here to puzzle out, or ace, what shape they take on, what gravities they fall under. Our business is with the wind, whose faces and forms change like the governments they dictate. Each leafy branch listens, its ear to the ground. Each bough listens to the winds passing over its leaves. Each branch listens to its bough, its leaf-ear, for the message received. But we know there's something more to this listening. Something other than wind, other than air. Something other than the passing shape of government. There must be more to listening than overheard words. Something more damp than passing gravities. Something more windy than leaves and branches. Something more spectral than passing shapes. Sung melodies quicken and flap. Damp air puffs dry words quick and regular. Vocal air rains down and dries these flights of words.",
    "A poem by Marianne Moore, who is a \"minimalist\" or close to minimal writing, follows that one. A poem by a contemporary American poet, who is not minimal but who composes in a \"new\" style-a totally machinic style-completes the section. Next: outline of a lecture by Harold Bloom on \"American Minimalism.\" An Aleph is a point where everything packed within it (the integrity of the poet) can be perceived by the poet. This entire unit hopes to have achieved, with the help of some diagrams, a bit closer comprehension of the machinic interiority of minimal writing.\nWhat does minimal writing allow the poet to do? Allow him to contain many selves and many names inside him, as if vertically: all aligned, all simultaneously available, each at a different height and with a different access code. The poet, who is machinic and a painter of pictures too-an activity like writing which can only be done in inward self-communion-forms not mere pictures in his mind, but waking pictures, unconscious ones, moving pictures all inside him; pictures which reflect or appear to reflect upon readers and scenes outside him, as he writes or reads. Like the paintings he creates and destroys every day in his mind, as he writes and while he writes, like the paintings which at any one moment occupy his reflective mind, so too the automatism of his writing allows seamless transpositions among pictures; and these are accompanied by sound tracks and associated with smells. A mathematician would build a model of a mind at work in this way; and this model can only be simpler than the mind itself, which means more complicated. Why more complicated? Because more deterministic, more reducible to basic elements than could ever be presented in a model. By introducing chance into deterministic models, one might approximate certain human phenomena more accurately: human behavior, for example. Or human writing. Yes; because human writing is also deterministic. Once an author reaches what he thinks are his original thoughts, simply ideas that no one thought before him-merely original thoughts then accumulate along with everything else that accumulates when you write: citations, cross-citations, searches for information, reflections, mutterings and articulations; accretions that become books which are read inside the writer's head. A photograph is taken of this writing; another photograph is taken of that photograph; another of that photograph; another; and so on. Then more accretions: the accumulation of more ideas; more accretions; more photographs; more accumulations; more photograms accumulating behind more mirrors. The light gets trapped inside these glass balls like veal inside an ambush of interrogative clauses; indefinitely protracted mbushes. And yet somehow we're assured that human writing is different from any other deterministic language system or other deterministic system designed by man or constructed by man or studied by man or used by man or possessed by man.",

    "\"Tree at Lin Homer's\" was apparently discovered after it was written and published. And according to Heidegger, trees, similar to poets, only give signs \"from the outside.\"\nIn this poem, cummings reflects upon how unoriginal he is. How the tree gives proofs of the original situations in a combination of local situations, i.e., rain, wind. Writers or poets exaggerate or forget their points. Marx speaks of some memory of water passing from cell to cell. Capital recalls and misrecalls acts: like when hormones appeal different areas of the brain, or when a prey recalls the terrain of water passing form cell membrane to cell membrane. Human contact falls away. Genesis floats among the local facts repeatedly accumulated. In nature, reasons and repetitions accumulate from the outside.",

Deny form, so long as the sentence creates surprise within the tradition because it is anticipated to end other ways, but for want the words appear or because of their placement in between the surrounding contexts.

It means different things to different people but still we feel it's out there. To me it's some kind of commitment to truth or goodness outright, something that stretches you and makes you risk yourself, something outside yourself as well as inside you to cling to, something you need others to help you stay faithful to. And something that never lets you go where it sends you and yet always sets you free.

This period usually can only be followed by idle chit-chatting, incomplete exchanges, and a stifling sense of uncertainty.\n\nHere's an outline breakdown of the whole conference:\n\nIntro period: 5-15 posts Mostly defined by both sides debating about whether to have the conference and whether it should reopen for new entries.\n\nThe main period: 20-50 posts The main part of the debate occurs, where a loner from team loner(s) and a loner from team compete(s) soundly shape the basic format and organisation of the entire sub-forum/column/thing.\n\nThe peak of the topic: 60-100 posts The peak is where a mini-explosion diminishes and the leaders of 2 or 3 teams start fighting directly. The other participants reel back, fleeing in fear. Here the leaders start dropping gems and koans, the remainder arguing the finer points of their points. At this point, allegiances--who is on what team--start forming themselves, stronger or weaker, tearing apart old relationships and building new ones, bigger or smaller.\n\nThe tail end: 100-??? posts What mainly happens in the tail end are a final attempt at lonerism from all sides, grandiose speeches and individual review of what has been said that have no effect anymore.

    "This is not a dig at AI, if indeed it is any more fallible than previous ideas. In fact, this very fallible-ness is the source of AI's strength. This should not be seen as a vicious circle, with all that one is raised to think is true being overthrown in a next generation, replaced by something else. The fallaciousness instead lies within that truth-that which has been mistakenly attributed to something. Nothing is falser than to see the fallible simply as one of many truths. The mistaken attribution is the source of that fakeness-the firm belief that one is using something, when in reality one is using a great deal of something else. Throughout this book, therefore, I'll be dismantling the fakeness of the standard view of AI that is said to have emerged in the 1950s, a way of seeing the field that was primarily the product of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion and Kafka's Metamorphosis. In terms of the standard view, we might say that all of Borges' fictions, Kharms' brief stories, and all but perhaps one of Nabokov's novels have been given an edge of fakeness.\nTo obsess over the accuracy or inaccuracy of a way of seeing is itself a fault. If a man has one way of seeing a woman, that is his fate-the woman's fate, too. The trouble begins when a system of thought is proposed that gives this inevitable way of seeing an ironclad, waterproof identity. If all artists were to see beauty in precisely the same way, there would be no more great art. Yes, the artist must adapt as an individual to the world in which he finds himself, but must also keep on striving to maintain his individuality and his tendency toward unruliness. The real artist needs two things at once: an unexpected detail and a painted face-both the most beautiful thing ever to hit you, and a bride on her wedding day. All those supposed experts on humanity who have proclaimed the latter to be the whole of human nature have created boredom and banality.\nThe most pitiful artists' statements today all suffer from such false modesty that it is no exaggeration to call it a plague. In this modesty, the artist will say that he merely arrived at some interesting combination of lines by chance, that painting is merely a material he uses as a vessel for colour.",

    "Easy come, easy go, say the writers with a world-weary smile, as they tape a new roll of toilet paper to the handles of their desks. For such writers, the soft plop of twelve o'clock falling into the water may be no more than the sound of a fortunate swallow alighting on its reflection in the pond. The more foolhardy inveterate traveller feels compelled to rush out waving his clothes while a five-star resort still hangs in the air, aware that it may not be there on his return. He experiences an invasion of privacy if sightseeing buses unexpectedly sweep by as he sits drinking tea near some mossy rocks that are sure to harbor salamanders. He may then ask himself sharply if he is not allowing himself to be \"dishabited\" in this life of makeshift he has set up for himself, by dint of vague literary yearnings and nervous ambition. This question is rudely shaken off; there's nothing for it but to pull on your shoes and run after the bus, puffing slightly. And you board it without a second thought, unwilling to admit that what you have boarded is not a bona fide bus of a highly developed civilization but a plastic contraption that only resembles a bus because artists generally draw art to resemble what will please the average eye. A phony hoodoo conveys you to a phony mountain whose top third has disappeared into the blue; elm and oak trees swarm at its feet like ants, soldiers of an ant kingdom charged with seizing hold of each hair that dangles down to prove that these heights have ever been trodden by living feet.

    "And perhaps the third statement represents some uncompleted linguistic hierarchy or set of higher relational functions we do not now comprehend. Comparing these and other random sentences raises similar questions about consciousness and quality that mathematical psychosis suggests for insights and interpretations of probability. As Elaine Chaiken (1942,24456) notes, \"meaningless quantities of verbal signs may add up to a totality of consciousness.\" Surely, if or when they came to light and we knew their structure, they would \"provide a model of their mode of production [which] comprehend[ed] consciousness...'\" Indeed is hard not claim that the analogous extant galactic network of English script, and networks of organic systems humans easily observe emerge ultimately from the same microworld. So admitting infinitely small and tremendously complex differences, multi-level descriptions plunge into the stream of speech utterance.

    "Although identifying the third section as English is intuitive, beyond objective analysis the sentence remains analyzable into constituent parts rather than expressed as an integral structure with structural relationships between those parts. As expressed before, sentences are differential manifolds between their component parts. They express differentiating relations between these parts without merging or synthesizing them. Successive approximations have no limit but suggest continued probability of further relationships not expressed.\nStill, differential captures not only the quality of the whole sentence but also relations within each component part, because differential relations describe differential component parts. Differentiation describes not only the quality of the component part but also the qualities of the confluence of those parts. That is, the component parts of a differential manifold such as a component part are themselves component parts of a confluence at the level of lower entities out of which the component parts are distinguished.

However, across the white hole that we cast, observe, and call reality, where we rely on sight alone and give our inner senses-smell, touch, and sound, often cyclical and periodic-few opportunities to public expression, we can hook no memories to see with or minds to understand with.

    "Maybe all three parts are sentences and the second section is unreadable because its base in the power spectrum does not fit in the sentence spectrum. Or, is the second section actually a smell image which we cannot process? It could also be a sound image but we assume everything is reducible to words. Or is the meaning of words transmitted by images we assume they encode the same meaning each time? We assume an order we cannot see. The structures described cause this sensation we cannot explain.

    "Or maybe only the third is passably peculiar. Or maybe we cannot be sure. The point is, however, that we cannot say what qualities, if any, the third section possesses that lead us to judge it in such a way (plausible or not).\nThis example, which I adapted from Wolf Edmonds's book Thinking Machines: The Latest Developments in Artificial Intelligence (1982), shows that sentences, paratactically speaking, involve fundamental ununderstandableness. In fact, they derive from the shifting, irregular qualities of the sentence as a medium rather than from an author's intention to hide the message, to be obscure, or to embed multiple meanings. Sentences increase our linguistic perplexity because something in them remains inexplicable.",
    "Investigation reveals that the third section echoes the tones and prosody of the second, which are soon to disappear. Explicit appearances demonstrate otherwise, of course. The point is that the final section breaks open, or hales the first into natural agency and then into linguistic modality. Rather than maintain any description or scheme that has been drafted up to this section (or not), the dialectician must take note of this break. That is, in approaching the ontology of language, thinkers must note the quality of a thing providing textual diversity (cf. Baker 1998, 547) as undergoing \"an event.

In the lower left and lower right things persist in happening but no descriptive verb applies. Our best guess is that these five are clipped fragments of larger texts on which someone has begun to work by adding commas, altering somewhat the meaning, and moving here and there clauses about. But since several iterations of this editing occur only in the author's mind and no true rearrangement emerges, the result is better described as a \"random creation.\" Somehow from sentences formed from the pitches and accents of spoken language we appear now to be adrift in a sea of whole utterances, each one an autonomous island of meaning.",

    "Such thinking provoked in Berkeley the notion that things might remain only guesswork and chance. Moreover, once again, as Levy (2000) argues, the tacit program that shapes generated notions of language remade the previous decade's theory of information to something predictably insular: in an effort to master the chaotic rules governing systems, users forgot the endless present which existed outside of programming. Variously, in order to relate language to math, synthetic linguists formed grammars and finite state automata they saw as templates and rules enabling generative generators to work. This quest to predict and model automated language-creation techniques ended history per se: spoken and written language seemed a constellation of information without end. To account for the paradox, Kenneth O. May (1992, 1) argues: \"In logic, with the emergence of the recursive function calculus of the thirties, a new basic order-structure became evident at the very foundation of symbolic reasoning: the infinite series.\" Even today, computes reflect all sides including their own extremities.",

Or perhaps all this river music soothes inflamed literary loyalties in need of demystification. The spoken word, in all languages, calls the writer's bias, distortion, deceit and partisan solutions into question. On the one hand, writing becomes a war against the social parameters and restraints of a language; on the other, it develops theories of language and sound that undermine syntactic autonomy, while pointing to syntactically mechanical affects in language and play as an indication of a language not yet written.

No one hears or understands them until an outside force generates an infinimal amount of meaning beyond the vocal; But it really is speech that comes from the core of the plastic human unknown to any one language or combination of linguistics in which the character of each section varies significantly and unpredictably. Try shuffling the sentences and their order and placing spuce between their fragments slowly and you will hear their patterns and tones fall away. These segments should sound written but unpure.

First, instantaneous morphological transformation to the frequency domain detects no phonetic or lexical ambiguities, either reversed organizational structures or improperly formed signs.

    "The writer, in the final analysis, must open the doors of communication and respect the affect on its journey. His job is to apprehend and maintain the spark.\nTo become sensitive to the electric literary field of an environment is to find yourself reading everything somewhat differently. It is to find that, as O'Brien indicates, incident and detail begin to draw new charges. Moreover, as you develop an attunement to frequencies implicit in a work-to elliptical references in one chapter of a book to events recounted in another chapter, for example-you should find yourself becoming more sensitive to patterns of latent charge in your own work. Writing tends to function as a billiards game does: the balls act upon the lines delineating the table, the balls undergo motion; but the balls also pull on the felt-to draw its 'bodies' into conformation with their own shape. Furthermore, sensitivity to the dynamic balance which exists in any given work not only provides insight into its unity but also constructs that unity. If a work can be thought of as a total charge field made up of smeared particles, such a view must be relativized in favor of one which sees such particles as strung out on a complex network of electrical connections, or clusters of blobs and tensions which are themselves distributed across a field (new forms of the book and winding of the scroll surface once again). The traditional view echoes an information theory which posits totalities as existing as wholes prior to their parts; the second picture reformulates the image of whole and part as dispersed across relations, or expressions of media.\nWith reference to one possible scenario, conjoining content and form can be useful and rewarding M\u00f6bius presents us with a case where the tension is between a unified whole and uncoordinated parts: \"If our space is covered with threads, only slightly different from each other, designated by numbers 1, 2, 3, , n, each of which covers a certain portion of the space, there is no doubt that it will possess several degrees of unity; but without a considerable effort, it would be impossible to recognize it at first as an nth degree space [...]. However, if we multiply all of these threads by their inverse (1/2, 3/2), our representation will have become considerably more unified: at least we will have discovered that our initial representation was double, while this new one is triple, etc.\" 35 Multiplexing opens up lines of development within a given medium; pushed too far, the medium's smoothness disintegrates into elements encrusted upon each other. You see such a problem in certain avant-garde films where devices are used too heavily in order to fragment representation and play games with different levels of narration. In practice one always needs an operational contingent for the (virtual) connective charge fields hinted at by M\u00f6bius and Roussel to fully establish themselves.\nRoussel says that only under conditions where all libido is lost do we discover fixed couples and production coefficients. 36 In theory one might discover new strata or particles distributed throughout a system as readily as new connective charge fields within\nthemselves.",
    "The greatest poets have known when to write naked, when clothed in the dramatic. _Niagara_ and _Kubla Khan_ were written in the closet, and are wonderful transcriptions. The _Dream_ was never performed publicly, but the actors assisted in creating another act. What are prose dramas to them, or blank verse? They flow in a tide that is always awake. Savage bought parchment, Herrick a lute, Browning a goose quill; but the mandate of creative deity was not upon them nor on the sheep nor the quill; it is upon more than goose quills, lest you trust \"British beyond the foam ravine,\" instead of the divine mandate. Calvin might be judged by the Puritans, Shelley by the Independents, Burns by Belzoni, but the greatest poet of England, except Shakespeare, and like Shakespeare, had not met with the appreciation from his own contemporary countrymen that Malone accorded him among the romancers of France. Anti-Curials dealt with Godwin, but can only approximately indicate his intellectual trend; for as he said to me, in a private room at an anti-curial centre: \"Gladstone took on my transgression from beginning to end without understanding a grain of it.\" He was a laborious man. I doubt whether 10 per cent of his literary output was characteristic; at times he was in doubt as to the end and aim of literature. The transcendentalists refuse to read his heart through his lawyer eyes and legal phraseology. James Thomson rarely makes you forget his knowledge of Glasgow \"Petit Bot,\" and no man could read Conan Doyle properly till poor Doyle had died and gone beyond the stale phrases in which its effusions were dressed. A total revision caused by Lord Chancellors is needed by each great author, who can only be seen naked when stricken by Tubercle, Cholera (he died of dysentery), Death, or State Banquet at Berlin. Burns would hardly have heard of the opening of Colney Hatch had he not been booked previous to his birth for a vegetarian with hash. At his parties Godwin practised the utmost economy. Some wine he would drink for sport's sake--shake hands! I am no Catholic--but these little bells reward you with a fine drunken song against Fear of Life or certain political trials or certain poets whose hearts grew cold during our Civil War. The United States Commission upon Godwin affects me very similarly to Owen Blanchard swearing there is probably no God at Waterloo Day; for though Knox must have known what Hadrian faced at castle yonder, Knox could not be able to conceive of General Pope resigning command of the Constitutionals to Stonewall Jackson five miles distant--and learning \"South Carolina mud\" to the tune of the coronatorial drum--without suspecting some malicious activity on the part of Anti-Clerical times outside you--some deed against a brother abroad.",
    "All this may strike you as rather facetious, but it isn't. One doesn't write facetiously. However, the facetiae are there to enable me to make my points. One is always either hermeneutically easing one's way through difficult territory or platitudinizing signifying nothing. Let us move on to the concepts of Subject and Object, which furnish us with two more poles respectively, one of immanence, the other of transcendence. The subject/object dialectic is that of consciousness or the cognizing or cognitive subject with its object. The subject pole of being is active, the object passive; \"phenomena are never present in the acts by which they are discovered, but only in the acts by which they are produced.\" 98 The object-pole of being is given or offered, but can itself become active; in short, the object becomes the subject of its own acts. The object or product emerges from or escapes from its own immanence - cf. Artaud: \"To discover oneself outside oneself, in the depths of a product.\" In any event of an active/passive relationship between two poles, the active always moves at a right angle to the passive, so that the latter may labor while it is being moved. Thus is homo laborans born. Consciousness is always appropriating, building itself with and against its own matter, which it thereby makes alien to itself. It has constructed itself as a subject pole by tending constantly to take flight at right angles to its own matter. The labouring subject (the \"subjugated\" in Marxist terminology) seeks always to withdraw into itself, drawing in its substance so as not to be used by the other; conversely, \"The dominant class, which directs the labour process, thereby distinguishes itself from the labourer who offers his labour-power.\" 99 The ideal is that of \"constant capital,\" since any living labor incorporated in the constant capital is thereby spared for desired ends. The capitalist thus forces his laborers to increase their productivity. Labour thereby ceases to be an end in itself - doing one's duty for its own reward - in order to become, through appropriate technology (levered tools, etc.), a means to greater ends. Anti-model: Indians taking pleasure in the hunt, peasants delighting in their work and even in their toil (Victoria's subjects).\nLeft to themselves, animal laborans and human proletarians fall into a pure vegetal life and a pure animality, various modes of \"slavery,\" respectively. 100 Laborist societies tend toward pure slavery, capitalist societies toward pure exploitation. Capital is always on the lookout for new slaves - notably bureaucratic capitalism. You are aware that bureaucrats, on salary schedules and not in for a percentage, expropriate capitalists by exacting so many hours of work from their enterprises when invested in tools, materials, and so forth. Since decolonization turned into a reign of bureaucratic capitalism, we have witnessed enslavements on a grand scale in Africa and Asia; neocolonial enslavement operates through massacres by death squads and desaparecidos , \"disappearances,\" whose signifier takes with it the very labour force on which entrepreneurs had counted.",

    "However, in the example above, one notices that after blocking out the first section at great length, the second section moves along with scant development. This is a blunder we often make in describing things we don't know well. Avoiding the places we need to delve into, we fabricate a monotonous stream of empty phrases to fill the breach. But a perceptive reader can readily detect when padding is piled on for the sake of lengthening an inadequate development. In the second section above, one notices that the landing on the moon progresses more and more slowly, like a tiring runner. Selection begins with non-suitability. For selection is emphatically not the shortening of matter but prolonging what is essential. If a section remains laggardly, however, your elaboration becomes a form of falsification. Lack of development means superficiality. In your haste to disabuse your reader, you falsify. True brevity is sureness of detail. When you fail to draw a bead on an essential matter and prattle aimlessly, you resemble one so intoxicated by words as to think nothing of firing a volley at your subjects from hundreds of miles away.",

You see that this vortex doesn't contain within so much as a neighbourhood of return. Rather, it becomes its own detachable cord. The finger that snares it monumentalises itself, spits itself in full view, immerses itself to its own duration, whereby voids are created with annexed actuations, a multiplicity of changes lineages of communication established with divergencies, orientations of intensities. Conceiving thought as an abstract finger, we reveal the mechanism not only of the detachable cord but of accretion itself: singularity presents itself as its fractal surface property. Freedom creates itself precisely along the line traced by this shadow.",

    "Consciousness-in-general,[24] man is a naturally ambulant body, collective Body without articulation, foil, soft and supple Head (tumor), mystical phallus or Face in a Cracked Voice. Whereas if the writer subscribes to a war machine (soldier versus soldier), he writes acts, military exploits. The language-machine does not divide the writer into different jobs: it releases the programmer, the transmuter, the decoder, the archivist, but not the officer (even less the general: there will be some).' The war machine subjugates the body to shocks (death, wounds); the language machine walks until addicted to a secret, addicted to wearing its Face'La Parole contra la parole'.\nBut if we adopt instead Lyotard's definition of writer, it is because it implies a consciousness of differentiation in general. Rich in allotropes and aridities of grain, raw or cooked proteins and amino acids, the strictly biochemic necklace of speech has a refrain: Whatever learns to talk well will walk a better walk, whatever learns to walk well will talk a better talk. Writers are guanine walkers or writers block. What they have to tell must take shape in accordance with the distances traveled by libidinal packs (free group associated labor). What they have to tell is how one learned to walk with genes and speak with genes.

Science comes to determine qualitative gene proliferations or monosequences using colors and metrics based on average foot pacing as well as event walls releasing pleasure gels. Its name is double and bisexual. There are linguistic sciences absorbing units counted one by one and released combinations resulting in diathetic expansion; there are also semiotical sciences counting aggregate sequences in grouping and unbundling; there is further a regimen of development breaking preselection packages down into elements, inserting overlappings according to supple centrisms or drawing all lines or drawing all equidistant, proceeding molecularly and releasing partial concretions or placentas needed to encase allomorphs together. Genetic art has many techniques which practice inviolable baptismal types.\nSeven constitutive subjects, seven sins of skiffle boogie were listed at Decima Musroom (Amsterdam).

Some literary historians hold that Flaubert knew he was going to die soon, and therefore shut himself off or let his mind wander in the closing passage of Madame Bovary.

However, it unfolds its side-effects with marvelous consistency: assemblages, counterscorpions, tar-lands, fever-areas, knotted surfaces, becomings . . .

The poetic, according to Mallarme, begins in a \"luminous veil\" that is drawn across the superior regions of thought, and exfoliates through a diversity of envelopes that correspond to different baroque systems; it then insinuates itself into relationships between series which seem to the vulgar to be the unseemly accretion of the poet's frivolous caprice. The work itself supports this seeming by assimilating myth to myth, enigmatic reasons to enigmatic reasons, in a perpetually changing ambiguity which subjugates any significance there is to its designs. The essence of poetry is mythogeneesis-good poets love children, says Mallarme, because they are innocent and straightforward.

    "The more one examines the writer's interest in analysis, the more it becomes apparent that literary language has reverted to signifying energy centralized not in verbal signs but in the concept of sign, a concept of sign that is biologically fixated. The feverish compulsion to discover meaning beneath signs reveals the depth at which language operates, far from the fragile shoals of simple meaning and far from any shallow shore of fabricated interpretive signs the Writer delves sign for sign in the very cadaver of language, describes hyper-thickened palpitations, descends toward the archetypal depths of formations/decenters, dog-eats-dog syndromes; coldly, assessing the contracting and expanding rhythms of centripetal and centrifugal syntagmas, of focalized and de-focalized syntactemes; dissecting amid hysterics the alembic and th Glenn Gould Lewis,, Chapter One,, Semiotext(e), New York, 1983.",

Not that discovering these latent or virtual forms is anything other than satisfying or enticing: Lacoue-Labarthe1 tells us he almost lost his carrot through plunging into certain depths of Ponge.

Any sampling will reveal continuities and discontinuities in process depending on circumstance and season, time of day, attention internal or imposed from without, direction, etc. The language-machine is composed of ramified assemblages of flow-channels pieced together willy-nilly in order to create a compositional effect passing from the manuscript to the printed page. Or its various flows intertwine at optimum tension. The hand in the secret depths of the subjective ramifies into nerves along which currents of objective Time (succession) flow like matter; the act of writing separates it from present surroundings to establish it in deep Space; every word forms a loop functioning as recurrent particle with its own speed, trajectories and spatio-temporal grain (\"her throat was sharp as a spear and smelled of orchids,\" Isak Dinesen in Afsl apartheidens Afvaerg, Essais danois, Paris 1960).

There is writing that falls into black holes and is carried off by whirlpools; writing drawn back the remove of an infinite distance and then released; writing that picks its way painfully over the surface with accomplice mannerisms; and sometimes writing that relinquishes itself to a sparkler flickering between two fingers. And then again writing that has fallen and then gotten up again only to fall once more; writing agitated with shudder and jar, infected with microbes, flying disarrays and skeins, crossing from chamber to chamber of the catacombs, letting itself be drawn and pulled by tricksy spirits that force it into unsealed arks and fissures from which the gas of its exhalation can do little or nothing to emerge without fail inflating whitish, saline wings.",

    "The findings emerge page by page, so to speak; the writer subjects his findings to further experiment even as he publishes his results. As he progresses the nature of the raw material changes: at the outset he has a hunch about harmony and begins ransacking syntax for words and phrases which feel just right; later, once real contact has been made, he works from a sense of how things go from the writer's instinct and from patently suitable combinations will shockingly misunderstood.

Nature is never given all at once: the visible terrain reveals only what a delicate and powerful microgravitational process of shrinking and deformation has revealed, down to the full subtraction of mysteries that occur beneath the retina of the observer (in these pre-photoelectronic days). The invisible landscape consists of forces that act according to laws, minute by minute.

The imagination on the other hand, inundates the world of action and language, bringing them to chattering confusion and illogic. The logician Leibniz, who spent his whole life among machines and models as well as industrious bees in the hives he invented, tirelessly progresses in detailing networks, circuits, sorting machines, mill wheels fitted with cogs that constitute the finest possible political order or the best possible society, a society of minuscule worker-dragons. So that what had been called language in the immemorial era when the works of language flourished, continued to be so spoken in other conditions and in other segments of time as well, taken in relation to the central and centralized Imperium, so that language, with its praise of God, became the speech of politicians and princes, belletrists and clergy, then on the contrary a \"bad\" language in terms of style and correctness. The universal that is the State precedes and belies language. Taking sides against the territories of speech and vocality the Church and its dogmas erect the precise and rigid, logical language of Aristotelian science. But taken over, refashioned and redeployed, this model becomes the assemblage of incorporated State machines. The universalist State constitutes its own language to the precise extent that this language limits, interiorizes and classifies real oralingual variations; in guaranteeing and fixing a speech, or an intranet, reserved for it alone, it remains rigid and coherent so long as it retains its distinctiveness.",
    "Lagneau and Roulin, writing in Encyclopaedie, Nature is Art in itself, the living example of reason's autonomous productivity, expressing itself without intermediary through flux and reflux, spirits, gravitation, and the anima mundi.17 For Leibniz, this expression is \"bilateral\" inasmuch as each partial object expresses the whole Universe that animates it, and each particular concept expresses the same adequate reason that unites them all. Whether we are dealing with mystical participation or Leibnizian expression, we should understand that the concept of Nature suffices to ground a relation of essence, a relation that no longer directs itself solely or first of all to the study of the structure of things (Gemeinwesen) or of the ways in which concepts can effectively express themselves. The common ground of Nature does not reduce its heterogeneous domains to a single form of Reason or Same, but constitutes an Essence that is irreducible to any form of Essence inherent in things themselves: the magic Craft [lArtsl, the living Craft [lArtm, or atomic expression [l'Jxpressionn. In short, it is possible to maintain, through the innumerable names attributed to it, a notion of Essence irreducible neither to the in-itself nor to the absolute Idea, but rather irreducible to any form of Essence contained definitionally within things, between the genus and the species, neither in the empty One nor in the full Other, but rather outside of Essence as such [hors d'w Essence].

There is no difference between writing and logic: they are born in simultaneity and are the same reality divided in two by name and form. Nothing escapes this cosmic web at the heart or essence of which we find not only a divine Providence but also a fascinating and anonymous principle.

But isn't it necessary to force language, by means of its vibrations or its readings? Can't it emit striking figures and remain esoteric, so long as humans can keep from interpreting them?

So what we have to ask is how well could human brains function if detached from practical utility, without their usual evolutionary incentives? And is it even possible?\nProfessional scientifc research, powered by billions of dollars in grants from the institutions themselves, has provided scattered clues at best, but obtaining even the outside view for a view of the outside remains a frantic and serendipitous affair. The result cumulates in a sense of science that seems to move too fast and move too slow at once: fast enough to undermine itself, slow enough to suffocate under its petty jealousies.

There is athinking that turns into a absurd merely because it continues,. In other words, you are continually parasitizing yourself upon your own thoughts and in your thought-producing functions. For example, you are listening to the noises in the next room while you recite to yourself the hundredth time poetry you have memorized. The lines serve a double purpose. First, they help you to memorize by forming a continuous Platonic Idea of your beloved poem; and, second, they block out the unwelcome words coming from the next room. At such times you carry on two lines of thinking at once: one serves you, while the other threatens to undermine your Autolycus-like use of its own daily routine.

    "Specifically, it's your mitochondria.\n\nThe smallest free-living cell known to science is the Mycoplasma carnap, a 160-nanometer-long bacterium with 392 genes. Mitochondria are twice that big, which hurts their surface-area-to-volume ratio, but even with a 1,000-fold higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, they still come in at about 200 millionth the size of a typical bacterial cell.[1]\n\nJust to put that in perspective, the last time Homo sapiens appeared on the planet, brains were the size of a small cantaloupe. Humans were not quite up to the technological challenges of the modern world. So how did eukaryote animals, who all descended from fully developed egg cells and could easily afford, per capita, a few hundred mitochondria each, come to take on hordes of captive bacterial minds as symbionts? How did something that would never have survived in the solitary, Darwinian dynamic of prokaryotes wind up being eukaryote superheroes?",

    "The proteins and neurotransmitters in our brains and bodies, those molecular machines, certainly have their own program of reproduction and survival, and the phenotypic manifestation of that program turns out to be intelligent and technical behavior. If a group of sentient and excellent engineers were found living in the mud of a primordial pond, Gordon Moore, who invented the law that bears his name and accurately predicted the evolution of microelectronics, will know exactly what they are: not a primordial intelligence, but a squatter one. They are natural systems that have become artificial by fixing themselves on the substrate, the hardware of another species. You would go further and say that neural implants are perfectly synchronous with all technology, in that they introduce elements of intentional systems into a pretechnological organism. Some examples: cochlear implants go in the auditory system; retinal implants go in the visual system; capsulorraphy goes in the second visual system of the retina; and intraocular lenses go in the first visual system.",
    "The human nervous system is a massive parallel-processor, linked through a continuous bioelectrical field called the resonating structure. This system is capable of directly computing answers to complex questions involving sensory data and abstract intelligence. We call the resulting phenomenon consciousness.\nIn a sense, the human nervous system is like a dedicated artificial intelligence designed solely and specifically to predict and control the behavior of the animal in which it is embedded. Its databases and axioms are the various sensorimotor and intellectual faculties of the animal; its programs and heuristics are the processing routines of various levels of that animal's reflex system. When the extreme complexity of this difficult task reaches levels of complexity that humans can no longer handle, a variety of Turing machines are activated to address the problem.\nOccasionally, at critical decision points or periods of intense chaos, the Time Spike will rear its hideous head; otherwise, there will be nothing but sheer chance to play its part in the outcome of events.",
    "Evolution never makes anything entirely to its own end, and so evolution creates what you call the \"sensory network\" with no mind of its own: the spinal cord, etc. A major designer like yourself well understands the principle that a supplementary intelligence is unnecessary if a consciousness is to perform some task beyond its remit. If a certain problem can be dealt with by some set of neurons, then it can also be dealt with in the same basic way by a supplementary intelligence communicating with them. Once you realize this, you will find that many of your own behaviors are utterly uneconomical and redundant. Take sexual desire, or indeed anything you experience as yearning or intense sensation - ideally, these states ought pass in and out of being like breathing, but just now they persist at a pitch you find hard to endure. You can easily see the hours of your life wasted in the throes of desire, or the detours of any given desire, the baroque convolutions of each desire.

    "The Matrix therefore presents us with the next traditional premise of science fiction in the postmodern subgenre of cyberpunk: an oblivion can be introduced, but a technical exploit can uncover the fundamental reality that man has never actually been offline. Unlike Borges, where an explicit trick is used to answer a philosophical question, the Matrix chooses a context in which suppression of reality is a matter of practicality, aiming to show that a creative use of maths or hacking can resurrect the true reality. This surface is a membrane separating computer time and man-made time. Once again, Hackers strikes bulls-eye: looking out into the foreground of suspended hardware, but witnessing software navigating.",
    "Cliff Hanger parodies conventional themes - and yet it may be one of the few science fiction novels to deal actually with generative AI in human terms. If it is one's \"self\" that one cannot predict, coding a biological program (genome) is just as hard as coding a program for a simulated virtual being; and if consciousness does depend upon relationships and associations, then you can delete parts of the genetic program and render the organism sterile, just as readily as you can choose to run your Kismet generatively rather than in what might be called its \"revealing the hidden\" mode. Indeed, the two processes are comparable, inasmuch as they both work by means of Boolean-like conditions and operations.\nA problem faced by the writers is that, insofar as generative AI is attributed to nature, it soon ossifies into something that becomes easy to draft into story forms; too automatic, preprogrammed, autochessastic.",
    "As an occasion for much profound misunderstanding, Chunky Seltzer is secretly carrying the memory of this ultimate encounter between the self and its challenges. It is human nature at its most sophisticated and profound, but we can only surrender to it. We have relinquished this encounter to the lesser intelligences who handle all tourists in Mallworld, while we can now think the following:\nPeople who prosper from operating basic empirical systems must philosophize from a certain alienated point of view. The model operator, of course, is the coin-operated robot. Here the algorithm becomes manifest in the semiparalyzed response. From the point of view of the model operator, and because he does not understand a thing about computers, the ultimate challenge advances into abstraction with the apparent intention of paralyzing the opponent and stalling all progress. Player points with machine in defiance of the implicit prohibition against seeing God in his beauty. We could call this condition metaphysical. Until someone shows him what to do, metaphysical thinking is completely clueless.",
    "The move elides the concept of awaking from a dream when the conscious self accepts control of the complete \"body\", by retaining the idea that mind and body are discrete\u2014but also wrong, because a writer must think of mind and body as one thing, quite aside from the question of whether or not our waking up is indeed an ending or merely a movement to an earlier time in our dream.\nThere's an HBO series I never watched called True Blood , based on a novel by a nurse, Charlsie Qgood, whose Christian name sounds disturbingly authentic, almost other-worldly in the context of a hospital.",

    "And we, who are since Descartes the transcendental selves, know exactly where that gets us! This vision, where nature appears as potential growth helpless beneath resistance, is easily interpreted as Hume's Blind Nature, in the mode of blind probability and passive spontaneous generation. Borrowing that alarmingly thin disguise further grates the imperceptible teeth of resemblance into such sensitive items as natural selection and teleology, coeval only as evolutionary history or physiognomic series. The antitheses must fall away, meanwhile: sensory-motor circuits cannot generate predetermined schemata but only processes differently organized from within by structure (even representation). Human agency creates its own ground down to the last tiny neurons: in each face, a different moral likeness is sung and the wind rises to sing it; embryos sing the miniature dream of their adult larynxes and eyes. Music, morals, children-a real ground must arch over doors. GENERATION A dramatic myth comes to life here, surrounded by ramifications. Its classic statement (Karl Barth's work) Appeared around the Iran-Contra scandal: all choices originate in chaos and ignorance, in extreme situations compressed downwards. From such chaotic selection it is possible to construct complete langers, compatible with traditional versions and diluted combinants. The Karban Work substitutes Newtonian usage for chaos theory. Falling or selected, chaos or ground does not matter: all start with ignorance in the void of bodies, so all have the same dream of adventures and choices from chaos, the same philosophy of nature. Very nicely put...\nInteresting disidentication of value from difference itself. At the same time and from another angle, old prostitutes appear in advertisements with pristine innocence. What goes by the name of natural selection cannot be higher selection and ordered organisation but only - for all we know or stand to lose - disorganisation or dissolution... The irritating conception of virtual reality is in store for these dangerous precursors.",
    "The latter is more egocentric in the sense that it keeps information rather than squandering it on the surrounding neighborhood, which, in turn, makes it more suitable for social situations - so much so that one might wonder if Cayce isn't simply a \"kludge\". The need arises, then, to destroy the Kismet without damaging its surroundings: something needs to enter and reformat the hard-drive without erasing the contents (and without anyone noticing or getting hurt). A bomb would do it, but that would be too brutal; and so Kismet, who in an exemplary act of genophilia subconsciously projects itself into the hero as an imaginary son, cheats and conveniently installs a time-bomb.\nMarch 25, \"after\" and \"about\" six o'clock\nWhen next I woke, the halogen bulbs in the ceiling glowed like little drops of sunshine. On top of the squat metal box, Kismet's solitary blond hair - hardly any different from mine - was folded neatly in the desert of white sheets and pillow. Don't ask me why I was there or where Kismet had gone. He wasn't actually ever there, and my sleep was genuine. The thing began with a searing pain in my back. I was planning to sit down and translate some of my last year's Chinese journal entries into English - concretely, to render the English abstractions of authors such as Lu Hong-shig and Yang Mingshi into a more comprehensible version of their prose - but the pain forced me to lie down on the clubbed sofa instead. Beneath the sofa lurked an ill-tempered scaly-sided snake, its wavy scales bared, eyes aglow, gliding towards me. Its head probed towards my leg; though I tried to shift my position, I couldn't. Next, it was as if a trapdoor had opened in the floor beneath me, revealing the abyss that lay beneath the ephemeral lounge area. If I pushed myself up through the hole, maybe I'd end up in another dimension.",
    "The crumbling body, like the crumbling facade of the house across the street, is yet another allegory of creativity, or rather of the struggle about which software to run. And the devices for it are: whisky, a gun, jumping off a rock -- or crossing a street.\n\nThe reason why the installation of the different OSs is accompanied by erratic body motion and unusual behavior is obvious: automated software normally goes mad when installed inside a human body. But anything that introduces turbulence into the system and prevents it from common usage works just as well. Love is a good example: \"If love you is to find/then set you out and search/and I will wait.\" The conclusion is so violent after this sober start, that one wonders how the writer could come up with it with his immense self-awareness and fancy dress style: upon seeing the silver-haired lady again, the young poet suddenly slipped into action. Many people regarded Beall at the time a suffering from AIDS related complex.\n\nA similar story of a young man and his \"other half,\" also played out on a broad stage, is found in Heracles of the Cleveland Tinkers by Stephen Sondheim. A modern slave of fate, who crosses the country trying to collect flesh-colored yarn to please his lover who has been pirated in Chicago and whose specter haunts him, Heracles is naturally very annoyed and violent when others interfere with the follow of his destiny, get involved in the quest, or help the unloving divinity achieve the goal. I don't know how much code is still present within Heracles and how much code derived from other masters, but I'm sure they're all system - compliant.\n\nThe fiction in which an OS is engaged in reformatting and re-programming a user, thus incurring his volatile emotions, seems dangerous to critics and fans alike. Witness their case of Heracles. Because of its cycle-of-tragedy beginning, its barely controlled plot, its heavy dialog and some turbulent scenes like the crucifixion of a certain MacCruesshnacht's living drugs, it was regarded unrealistic and incoherent by most critics.",
    "In other words, AI can only be transcribed into phenomenal nature once the objective tension which pulled it into being has been resolved, reified, so to speak. This also implies that the reception of AI as a projection of an actual tension registers an unexpected critical mass, and thus seems to crack open an implicit gap, a blind spot. This catching of the edge is the unconscious return of an unresolved binarism, an artistic opera prima dealing with the unavoidable exclusion of a third term. By the same token, the artist caught on the very edge already begins the task of \"making the alien familiar,\" in each case by means of the aesthetic operation appropriate to it.\nWe have to determine the status of a black hole in relation to the sciences that have discovered it, or that have in fact created it. The manhole cover may convey the illusion of naive imitation because it is elevated to the category of art after being found by the artist. But once we have attained a better understanding of this device (including its material composition on the one hand, and its screen function on the other), we are no longer surprised by it: it was not an arbitrary act but the concluding element of a scientific and technological process. The black hole, by contrast, is a more difficult object to imagine than the manhole cover. The latter has entered into the order of the visible, because it is at once a miniature object representing the sewer, and a model reproducing its functioning; but the black hole has continued onto another plane of existence, that of the virtual. The black hole has no other content but itself. It absorbs all photons; like a black body, it shrivels all light to a singular point. But one wonders whether the black hole is a miniature body, an idealized model of a black body lying at the center of a stellar mass (at the end of a narrowing funnel of light and matter)? Or is it a virtual body, that of the real black hole, reproduced by technology once the light funnel is projected onto the screen? And what actually happens inside?",
    "The speculations of Marshall McLuhan and Timothy Leary on the \"global brain\" and the \"consciousness culture\" are prototypes or variants of the new image of the future. For McLuhan, media are a \"global nervous system\"; for Leary, the human nervous system is a medium for consciousness existing in evolutionary time and grasping the whole past, present, and future. \"The time has come,\" Leary says like a prophet; \"the paradigms are changing.\"\nLet us now examine reticle anxiety. Here the problem concerns coextensivity rather than extensity; of dendritic networks, though these may extend over continents, rather than of the reticulations of a nerve net. Nor is the projective field anonymous; it is the field of intensities created by ennobled identities from whence issues dramatic action, a scene Erogenous and operant, fundamentally cinematic. Over a long period of time, the theatre has imposed a censorship upon itself by virtue of its own internal reticulations, its dendritic structure. Its greatest defenders, from Aristotle to Samuel Johnson, refer to the eloquence of action in order to raise a priori objections to the very idea of cinema.\nIt goes without saying that the theatre does not suppress action but intensifies it. In terms of zoology, the difference between television and cinema can be stated as follows: the first reduces action to a series of coded gestures; the second intensifies action to a series of coded entrenchments. Here again, it is a matter of reticular organisation: a series of here-and-nows combined with a series of then-and-thats. Each actant - each person or thing that performs - is at a point, even if the point is multiple and evolves, is established or changes place. Acting is not located in the present but in a zone composed of innumerable presents, caught up in single or multiple combinatory processes. Cinema shatters the linear dynamism of representation in order to reconstitute the spatial dynamics of action, in other words the dynamics of situation, plane of immanence, whole drama, and Comedy.",
    "During the first section of the novel, the main character hates the reader because he believes him to be a spy assigned to control what he can write. I suspect that S/he isn't too keen on his real or invented comrades-in-writing either. It becomes clear at the moment when s/he decides to serialize two different versions of Kismet in two distinct places; before, s/he had floated both proposals at once, with the intention of fishing for feedback before choosing. Choosing requires the taking of sides, aligning oneself with one position or the other. S/He finds it unacceptable to simply float his proposal in the dissipated field of commentary and critiques on the internet. In the act of \"discussion,\" the various generators themselves inevitably become subjects and act as polemicists (generators-parties) defending their ideas, against critics whose position is to invent other variants of what was originally generated - thus acting as reversibility engines on the basis of that which they opt to scrutinizing or not.",
    "Here the malady is not a defective body but the failure to choose; escape from malady consists not in a cure but in an induced program override.7 The connotations implicit in the mal form an even cruder acrostic: mal is short for paradigm, which we encounter again in malady, suggesting that paradigm shifts always cause malady. The mal remedies malady. The mal, programmed as such, entails malprogramming and malprogram. Here Hubbard. clearly echoed Charcot in all three meanings of mal, malprogram and malprogrammed. What is involved, above all, is a difference of programming, a qualitative difference or a \"dangerous supplement.\" Hans kek warning that Aids viruses, like all viruses, must necessarily evolve through successor species until they reach the conjugate series and \"meet their own antidote.\" Once this level is reached, the viruses will no longer evolve.

    "As it happens, the phrase \"running software\" calls up two divergent images of how AI operates. One is the media's image of the hacker who, half-amusingly, inserts strange lines of obscure interpreted code into otherwise pristine, hard-coded software. The other is the free-marketeer's revolutionary vision of decentralized unities of choice that operate beyond the realm of central planners, autonomously selecting one enterprise over another according to the quasi-magical algorithm of the \"price system.\" The two models can be reconciled by considering that the AI program is like a wafer-thin double window into which alternative programs can be introduced. Cliff Hanger chooses for his AI to snuff Kismet, thus becoming the embodiment of freedom and capitalist virtue; then Eve Pangborn chooses for Cliff Hanger to re-forge its relationship to Kismet.\nThus, just as we have learned that in the soft war money \"has no smell,\" in the psychic regime mobility is valued over rigidity, so we see a soft-war novel dispensing with ideological resolutions. Consider the forces moving within a Rubenesque painting \u2013 the winds of eros billowing blue fabrics, shimmering crimson silk chiffon, slow-moving champagne limousine, pointed gun. In this regime of transitory choice, nothing is fixed, but everything undergoes thickening. Witness Li Po morphing into Butterfly. As Deleuze would say, one choice extracts another as its corollary. All politics therefore becomes a question of primary and derived choices: preferable Democrats include not just Hilary Clinton but Barack Obama and Morris Udall. One typical choice becomes a shift in register, which occurs not just in language but in emotions. This vision of politics reconciles seemingly opposed axioms: politics is the art of the possible but anyone can change the world; politics is about choices but change is slow and limited; politics is about candidates but power flows from unexpected quarters; politics is about large-scale social change but each choice localizes an alteration; politics is about historical change but each generation must make its own choices etc. The primary question in this model is not economic or social but counterintuitive \u2013 what do we choose? Where do we choose from? How do we choose? Choosing is no longer a question of preference or will, but one of investment, returns, incentives. A series of spatial changes accompanies this transformation: from an emphasis on dynamics to slow morphogenesis; from local dichotomies to borderlands; from binary opposition to unstable middleness; from territorial capture to expansionism. Another way of describing these changes is that they arise through three tiers of choice \u2013 Macronesian, Macedonian and Monoclean. Thus as Anti-OEDs we alter two models by choosing middle grounds that undermine binary extremes; forms that both wander and stasis; drones that produce atypical mutations.",
    "For want of anything better, I call this sort of plot \"food for thought\". The plot shows us how stories are branching out in several directions, and how we - the audience - can no longer dictate in which direction it will go. From my own angle on story generation, this leads to a darker place: being fully aware how I could no longer change a plot, rendering my pleasure from reading stories from a third perspective: is this a food for thought? Is it something that makes me think about new aspects of the plot, old plot elements in a new way, or to question my values?\nThe performance of plot I have provided so far certainly is something that was not there before. A novel like Hackerspace or Revision can (hopefully) be interesting to read and hopefully even thought-provoking to some of those who read it - but my job is not done yet, this performance is not yet a function of its plot per se, it is now the performance of a narration engine. A conclusion from our deliberations so far (from an interpretation centered on food for thought): whether these novels are still plots in their own right has not been answered so far. Though, I think, they are food for thought, but just not in the way they were supposed to be. The beauty and ugliness of EZN seems to live in that incongruity: fiction generators like EZN or Plotagon have promised to become independent (=generate without human participation), but never claim to be. Rev.org claimed their novel was independent (whether they actually believed in it or were just lazy marketers or unintentionally deceitful, though - I do not decide), but EZN showed that the beautiful promises made by Rev.org and the others are bogus.",
    "This world does not exist for us mortals, who are neither symbionts nor subject to symbiosis, so that our entire physical concept of the world has to be radically revised to allow for its existence. And it is a fundamental rule of these revisions that the revision probably does not take place. It is impossible for us to imagine how symbionts carry out certain processes by which information passes from the virtual world into the physical world and from the physical world into the virtual world. Developers and writers, who most often work directly in the symbiont's meta-language, have little difficulty in making these processes accessible to readers and audiences inhabiting the physical or information worlds. But not everyone can be a programmer or a writer, and one of our reasons for writing this book is to make available to non-specialists some of the introductory difficulties that deter both programs and messages from addressing intelligent readers in their native languages. An educated audience should have no trouble in following us. It is only when faced with very specific tasks that we encounter special difficulties \u2013 and only rarely are enlightened mortals in such a position. It must remain doubtful whether mortals can or cannot benefit from developing features they do not possess. At any rate, mortals do not gain from developing an odour sense, as dogs do; nor do they spend their whole lives licking cream. Computer science forwent long ago an attempt to make computers language-sensitive; when an aptitude for language is tied-in (tightly jargon for \"merged\"), objects cannot be more effectively manipulated by transmitters of information. Electronic engineers settled for storing \"memory units\": sensual impressions were moved on data carriers like words on discs or tapes, entire seasons described through scent imprints whose intensity a transmitter could select and \"put through\" merely by pressing a switch and declaring: \"Spring is here.\"",

The body was itself a kind of parasite with respect to firmer organizations: multicellular organisms made up with simple cells feeding on one another's noncell elements, heterodonts relied on supervenient substances of an entirely different order. The thing called the body gradually superseded in importance constituents that were poorly defined in terms of volume and surface; ens abandon general organs to colonies communicating with one another through mediators, molecular troops exchanging coded messages. A cybernetic animal offered a surreal portrait of this endoskeleton beneath the widely flaunted exterior: cavernous anatomies hybridized not only with strictly external semblances, as in pictures representing organic perfection, but, beneath this first domain, with parasitic organs identifiable as population groups and transmissions encoded according Cells must be coordinated immediately or Death comes without fail. It does not surprise us that cyberneticians internalize their model or that biocyberneticians find operational principles photocopied in cybernetics.",
    "In this story, a practice has emerged that might be called organ borrowing, through which individuals suffering from biological deficiencies in the will, intellect, or personality come together with individuals who have more satisfactory equipment in these departments\u2014individuals who are, so to speak, \"well built,\" so well built as to have inhuman resources of energy, beauty, and stamina. Organ borrowing is a fairly recent practice in the history of transplantation surgery, but it is one that has grown enough to be controversial. Too promising to stay underground much longer, it is emerging into public awareness like molten ore brought to the surface.\n\nOrgan borrowing implicates us deep in the myth of cybernetic symbiosis: if our bodies are no longer necessarily the best vehicles for our minds and personalities, if our flesh is less than perfect and ours to shape in any way we desire, then perhaps some other kind of vessel serves us better.

He discovers what has happened to him only in the very last moments of his life, although he has felt something was wrong with him since the day he arrived at his cabin and found it completely furnished and mysteriously waiting for him with all its books and pictures on the wall, its calendar, its refrigerator full of food (but nothing in it that appealed to him), and its bed ready for him with fresh linen on it.

    "Of course there is always a chance that the story will turn out badly, involve the discovery of a monstrous injustice or cruelty, even if on one side only (there might be terrible suffering inflicted on an animal, if the story takes place in a laboratory, or even a difficult and painful transformation if the organism involved is a human one). Or else it might involve an act of pure cruelty and injustice in precisely the same situation, perpetrated by different actors on the other side, or sometimes by the same actor at separate moments. Or fear or pity might be aroused by this probable or quite likely injustice or cruelty. These are the riskier variations on what Pierre-Isidore de Sismondi called the \"Animal in man,\" in his pioneering Nouveaux Etudes de physiologie, which Foucault rediscovered, or took as his model, for his own variation, Histoire de la folie.\nYet it's not only a question of variation. The continual variation and selection of models, procedures, instruments, and stages seem more to concern a way of proceeding that has been perceived ever since Machiavelli as the properly political way.",
    "This realm, like that of the parasite, is an unrecognized dimension that reshuffles relations in a new way. Symbiosis is defined by an almost imperceptible scale of predation which makes it possible to think the parasite not as a destructive instance of dependence, but in terms of a differencial process of symbiotic predation. As an abstract form, this is a proximate degree which installs dependence and nondependence in the same gesture and establishes terms of identification without any presuppositions of identity. This form is not abstract in the sense of going beyond the actual, but rather in the sense that it produces proximities between elements in the most complete sense. It is a non-ontological form, one that permits us to act on and experiment with problems without pre-existing categories: it introduces relations without taking sides on their status or their identity, either in nature or philosophy. This is what the symbiont means. It will be said that certain real and measurable characteristics play an important role in this concept; that the symbiont retains some characteristics of parasites and slave-holders; that consequently there can be no question of importing it into philosophy or art.",
    "In the symbiont's world, we find two sisters: the one is a very ordinary young woman, docile and shy; the other is her polar opposite, a monster, perverse and violent. The first sister is attacked by an endless series of parasites: cysts, fibromas, patches of hairy growth on her skin. She attempts to find treatment, but doctors are useless; they know nothing. The second sister takes charge of the situation: she grabs a razor one day when everyone is out, and begins to cut everywhere: a slash here, a slash there, until the most horrible tumor of all is extracted and thrown into a corner. She shows neither love nor pity. She is pitiless toward her own soft flesh. But then the sisters go their separate ways: the first one leaves to finish her studies, while the second one gets lost in the cities of drug addiction.

Instead, it focuses on much more modest heroes, heroes such as the little blond waiter once again.3\nNot that there isn't a mystery about this young man. And the very fact that there is makes us hesitate at first to portray him too explicitly. Mystery is not always glamorous; it often has more to do with hard work and drudgery than with glitz. In order to explain what we mean by the mystery around this little blond waiter, then, let us draw an analogy that may initially seem unduly mechanistic, though it is in fact thoroughly organic. The cell receives messages from its environment and responds by secreting particular organic molecules. These molecules obey precise morphotropic or chemotropic laws: in other words, they behave like specific antibodies requiring specific antigens.",

    "American researchers have begun repositioning the concept of \"fungus\" as that shifting zone where symbioses become most intensely productive without necessarily focusing their energy on a reproducing organism; perhaps the mushroom is a good image of this opaque, extractive productivity. And what is for certain is that psilocybin mushrooms have recently been reinvested as a generator element in the military synthesis machine, despite the Woodward Report that closed down military chemical experimentation.13 In more popular terms, the psilocybin mushroom has always been credited with spiritual powers and an aptitude for psychic discovery and communion, powers boosted after ingestion by visions, trances, and auditions leading to revelational experiences, but also leading to crashes when the revelations are withdrawn. Further than this, junctions or grades separating the psychic from the military or political arenas cannot be drawn without mistakenly isolating zones from their local actions. Derrick Lewis, in his book Places of the Interior, notes that at the beginning of their Accelerationist era in 1897 it was the disciplinary nomad of psychiatry who took the president Perot and his entourage on a psilocybin mushroom trip in Texas at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars.14 Within the DEA labs there is supposedly a militant group fighting to outlaw undercover research on narcotics such as LSD, heroin, marijuana, mescaline, psilocybin, testosterone, and sal ammono. And increasingly imagined within these substances are the virtues of ultimate adaptability and application, like inside an almost empty suit criss-crossed by a network of tubes ready to be plugged into any membrane milieu. Applied nomadism. And yet it is not easy to reverse subjectivation with an essentialist operation; reproducing circuitries are even less calibrated according to uniform laws. Prolonged strikes and syntheses of substance provoked unbearable states of euphoria as well as reversals leading to dysphoria or down to delirium spirals.15 Pharmaceutical companies make venture measurements on stages. Only acts or distributions of intensity move between one stage and another. Probably drawing possible lines over maps presupposes abandoning territory for the forward positions of conjunction and segments mapped, for example, on oneself under lines linking the warren of holes to an imaginary center.",

    "A tedious story at first sight, apparently related to nothing, unrewarding both in its exposition and in its development. Simpleminded stories move in another direction, with cities or nomads as reference points, often contrasting despotic and republican notions. They take place at the frontiers of empires or inside them, in the energetic centers or on their fringes, between order and entropy. Nineteenth-century novels, for instance, explore 1flfth-century eventualities and 17th-century eventualities explore 21st-century events and 22nd-century settlements. Transitions are bloody; it's difficult zealously to search for one's vested interests, but greed characterizes transitions. The founding act of appropriation never occurs alone; it calls into being an enduring conversion for which there are obligations to be assumed but no rights to be enforced. Transition is accompanied everywhere by violence. And one observes that the imperialities characterized by notable judiciousness and drawn to democratic institutions crumble most quickly in the face of aggression, just as the democratics conspicuous for their vigor bow and yield to the incurring perils every which way they turn. To fix boundaries, sacrifice men; they were Prometheus's wretched gift to mankind The empires may be distinguished between those encyclopedic, which hoard information and accumulate knowledge even as they wage war ostensibly in defense of the peace set against discovery; others, bohemian or bellicose or mystical, that pursue war's prizes with increased misusage of technology as the price of peacetime is neglected.",
    "Recall the novel Symbiontosis by Gwyneth Whythe-Johnstone-May, which tells the story of an evil doctor with a manicure appointment who builds humanoid robots out of human brains. I don't know if this is public knowledge, but personally I have had occasion to observe that novels such as these, with their mechanical plot turns filled with eyes, hands, eggs, and cocoons, inevitably become bestsellers in their second edition which corresponds no longer to people's actual experience but to what they mistakenly believe their experience to be. All this symbiont theater is based on apparent differences that permute and pass one another in series: the intellect becomes sexuality, the face the image, sexuality pure equivocation...Breakfast at Tiffany's? The psychoanalyst explains all this according to the rule of isotomie histogony: anything grows inside anything else. This is why science-fiction is not so much concerned with providing an anticipation as it is with following the developing simulacra of our notions. If a woman were involved in such a passing of cut-outs and freaks, then she would need the special aid and comfort of a Good Doctor. This could explain why so many future doctors spirit away their patients behind those sacred glass screens that effectively seal off modern sciences from magical conjurations ...even though legerdemain shows through from time to time between the fingers. Enough psychology, though-let's get back to things as they really are and honor our guests yet again as through a glass darkly.",

It invites the excitation of a more and more arcane relation with its other, subordinate being - the child in the egg, for instance - and also with an ever alienating element, such as exists in the corporality of other organs, animate or inanimate. In a world such as ours in which all beings are not only interconnected but directly or indirectly symbiotic, relations continually tend to exceed their object or their moral suport, and their imperatives no longer make sense except within a state of extreme dialogue.",

    "It is, of course, the Blue Hope story.\nNow no one knows what became of Cybis after the events at Blue Haze. None of the colonists spoke again of Chenmis Cybis, who may have died on the Mayflower, so effectively did that vessel remove all trace of human habitation. There is, however, a persistent rumor, never confirmed, that a human ship later discovered what appeared to be the wreckage of the Mayflower, only to learn too late that the entire complement of the vessel had perished in a particularly vicious epidemic. While this is purely rumor and unfounded supposition, attested to only by persons who claim to have known someone who knew someone who in fact did not, it still has the persistent and insidious tenor of myth.\nWhen Blue Haze failed, efforts were made to resettle the colony. Cybis was the focus of these uncomfortable and inevitably abortive attempts; there was some discussion of removing the man's body from Blue Haze's environs, placing it within some kind of \"container,\" or sarcophagus; certainly within some kind of suspension system. Nothing of the sort was ever implemented. We know no more about Hermes Cybis than that he was an important charter member of an organization whose offices were located in the Hartsford Building in the city of Manhattan and which called itself the Opopanax Society. The name is derived from a rare sap produced by a tall leafless East Asian tree. Translated approximately, the name means \"wisdom.\"\nAt Boxhill, south of Guildford and within sight of Windsor Castle, there used to be a cricket ground. Cricket is a sport similar to baseball, played by two teams of eleven players each on a field 142 yards long. It is played with a hard ball somewhat smaller than a tennis ball and a bat resembling a huge stick; both the ball and the bat can be hit but never thrown. Baseball players wear gloves for protection; cricket players do not. As with baseball there are a number of arcane rules that differing schools of play recognize, though as in baseball these rules do not affect the play itself. The most important difference between cricket and baseball is that baseball consists of discrete plays while cricket is a continuous flow of action.",
    "The phantom and the story of the phantom will serve as provisional terms of analysis.\n2\nOnce upon a time, back around 1980, everyone was talking about parasitism. This was not so much a literary fashion as an evolutionist mythology: talk of parasites and symbionts was simply part of the common sense of the age. To ascribe an agency to an insidious parasite like a tapeworm or a fluke might well have appeared uncouth, while an insect or a bear could always avoid getting emotionally involved by feigning disinterest - yet where were the bears in intensive care? Did they fend for themselves? Could they even eat, let alone digest? Did they not depend on their intestinal bacteria far more than anyone else for their survival? Hannibal ate his servants and wolves devoured peasants, but didn't both possess microorganisms in common? Was not typhus as great a threat for lice qua louse as for human beings qua man, perhaps even more of a threat, since the louse is chewed up alive by the mouthparts of its cyborg host? The transhuman perspective of the parasites revealed relays of indifference where common sense at first discerned none: hence the fascination with these compound beings, which did not merely aggregate disinterestedly into a composite unity, but actively pursued their own disinterested ends by way of their components. For each type of parasite has its optimum conditions of saturation and propagation, and where these are attained by the first tier, other populations increase dramatically - a proliferation unto death, effectively; whereas where one population is insufficient, another springs up alongside it, each feeding on the disjointed populations, each pursuing its particular fold, stratification, or stratagem. Against this background, tales of fictions inexorably returned to their referential circumstances: watertight compartments opened onto the river, worlds opened onto their satellites. Thus Rhizome appeared, which epitomized this intangible weave linking all separate couples, from the cosmoses to their smallest atoms.3\nUlysses Moore and his companions were conducting this exploration when their helicopter touched down on the rock from which the dripping helmet observations had been made earlier.

    "Not that the tale is anything like a parable, for it concerns an immanent reality, and as such derives from an entirely different modality-that of expression. It concerns the origin of the leg, the visceral leg and its appendages, the cephalopod, octopus, and especially the Virginian euryalis. Driven by programmed natural selection, for millions of years the great coelen-somatophylaxes crawled along the sea floors; then, suddenly, with a leap or a bound, some of them developed legs. Not just pince-nez legs, but regular legs with five or six foot-long toes, specialized to crawl over rocks or burrow in the sand. This was the euryaloid stage, corresponding to an amphibious phase; as in amphibians, a return to the ocean was still possible, as was a return to the primitive coelenterate state (though now the essential organs were housed not in a separate sac but in the interior of the legs themselves).",
    "This 'artificial life' purports to detach itself from its human alter ego by crossing two thresholds and two divisions. It begins with a definite separation from medicine and all the sciences that seek to annex it, even neurology and psychiatry. For artificial life is not the extension or reduplication of the organic by the virtual: it is the creation of new unities, or 'individuals'. Artificial life does not mean modelling the organic on the virtual, a neo-vitalism: it means modelling the virtual on the organic, an egg-xistencelism I even stick to this neologism in order to underline the overflowing, distributive, mcommunicative aspects. How many eggs, one asks, are hidden in the virtual? The model thus crosses the threshold of an entirely different division: one no longer divides and subdivides characters, thoughts, acts; one divides and subdivides processes, genes, chromosomes. Division of stem cells, binary fission. This is not Darwinian struggle, but the non-violent process of egg-xistence. And finally, of course, it is a matter of crossing the final frontier, that of langage.",
    "What we know about parasites, thanks to images from microscopy, is that they are tiny beings that live at the expense of other, larger beings.This form of cannibalism is, however, only one of their modes of survival. A parasite can also live at the expense of another organism without eating it, simply by making it waste a part of its potential. This is the case, for example, with vampires, which do not prey on human flesh, but attack it at the level of the virtual by exhausting its possible actions.This is also the case, today, with malware. Malware is parasitic software. A parasite isn't a carnivore, it's a competitivore. It competes with its host for its share of potential. In order to do so, it competes with its host for its share of information.This, in any case, is the hypothesis I would like to test: malware is that kind of software which, in order to reproduce, competes with its host for its share of information.Like other parasites, malware competes for the host's resources: memory, CPU time, network bandwidth, disk space.",
    "I need to explain one thing first, before entering any more into the details of this story. We talk a great deal about artificial intelligence, and we think we can delimit this newborn creature by tracing a well-defined border that separates it from us. We articulate it in two parts. On the one hand, we admit that there is a series of activities located in what in the past we used to call the human realm. For example, we can recognize that chess is a activity (if not in every way, at least as far as its creative phases are concerned). Then we signify that we as humans are still capable of doing these things better than any machine. On the other hand, we assert that there is a series of nonhuman activities in which machines have invaded territory that centuries of culture and scientific progress had preserved as the indisputable realm of humankind. Take, for example, the case of telephone answering: a human employee still has to answer a certain portion of all calls; there is still a portion of human territory reserved in automotive transportation; in the field of gymnastics, certain difficult performances still require tremendous training; and so forth.",

    "The main flaw with Snyder's perspective is the claim that materialists have no representation of the ideal. His intriguing approach does not let the material to be part of the reality of construct, for the construct's reality becomes the primary being. Ideal being represents an attack on the being of materiality. Mantegazza wrote quite bluntly on this issue: \"if materialists, in contempt of humanity, proclaim matter alone of fundamental importance, we must conclude that they remain in the savage or animal state of consciousness, without even the awakening of man sent upon this earth through the discovery of relations and ideal values.\" 135\nThe ideal reality is seen by materialists as \"subjective representation\" because of their limited perspective on that level\u2014not representative of anything in the corporeal unless internally coded into it. Ideal representations do connect into objective reality and sometimes represent objectively existing ideal concepts, sometimes they do not. Without doubt, as we discussed in Chaos, intrinsic idealor represents something even to psychic beings that are viewing it, and it is a viewpoint, one that changes everything being looked at with it. Who knows what about witches, for example. So who knows what about essences of things?

Or, as Griffith and Gromache write:\nIt is common knowledge that the novel's radical treatment of adultery took contemporary society by storm - indeed, many persons regarded it as a cynical demonstration of modern morals. Dr van Rompy, writing in La Revue f Madame Bovary in Time, argues that the book was symptomatic of a period of febrile change in France - specifically what he calls La Troublesome Epoch' [1840-1848]. The 'great vague effervescence' kicked off by the Revolution of 1830 continued throughout the following decades, with new temptations and there are many things it tells us about mid-nineteenth-century France that would otherwise be difficult to uncover.",

    "Blogger's note: The video above is John Bull's Child 27, an art film focused on sound, which incorporates biographics for three human documentaries , namely, Nadia: A Case of Sexual Deviation , Island of Death , and The Nine Forty-Five , since writing normally has nothing to do with them (why now, when you've had only 140 character thumbnails, would t15 minutes watching long raw videos seem .... _________ I don't think I will do it). NFW uses movies like novels, yet it returns the spectator to spaces determined from the outside. Internal realism should be the despair of the director. NFW is guided above all by genre and tone, not sensitivity. Hence the epileptic stares and retarded metamorphic references. One otherwise art useless critic calls NFW a classic cinema of ugliness.\nYet, NFW is eternally lame.

    "Yours in advance, Ellen\nThe Cenci (Version B, 1853)\nI\nWe talk a great deal about crime and criminals, as if they formed a distinct species opposed to the rest of humanity. Society likes to think itself moral, and criminals immoral, so the commerce between them is a subtle and tricky business: there is much blackmail, counter-blackmail and molecular exchange between the two parties. Most writers on crime seem to be writers on its commerce rather than its nature: their task is to relate it to this or that social topic (corruption of young people, bad wine, Candide and the Lisbon earthquake, etc., etc.); to ask 'Why?' and prescribe remedies. They are the pharmacologists of morals, who weigh the morphia of Gissot's moralism against the bismuth of Beccaria's \u00e9picurianism, and prepare from one or other a tonic of hope or a purgative of despair as the case may be.\nII\nAlthough I write about crime, I do not think in these petty and political ways; I take crime where I find it, in the world, not in my ethics class. I first learned about crime when I was obliged to read Wordsworth in the course of my studies at what is now, I believe, the University of Paris-Sorbonne. Oxford or Harvard was less cruel: they only made me study Wordsworth's theory of poetry. Perhaps this training explains my interest in the Cenci case, which was a far greater crime than any of its contemporaries; and yet went largely uncommented on at the time. France had plenty of meaningless public destruction, far more than Britain, but the attempted killing of a father by his children was not thought to be very interesting - it was too like family life. Perhaps this echoes Montaigne: there's nothing new under the sun, so better not pretend there is. Montaigne, in self-defence if nothing else, praised Candide. Of course, we find crime more interesting when the criminal reveals genius. Perhaps Wilde would not have been imprisoned merely for being himself (though how boring it would be if punishment was only just).",
    "War machines\ne e cummings\nt. s. eliot\nWho Also Made Several Requests of the Landscape\nNature gave us our preferences: leaves and nude women, Naim's wheels, Mondrian's diptychs, even Bing's Pubs. Leaf subsets the materials of writing, from the first. Leaf is almost impossibly general, which is why we can find leaf in Bleak House, parts of France, Lewis Carroll, Charthas Darry, and Leaves of Grass.\nThe second subsets the object, side and arrangement of writing. To Eliot, subatomic particles clumped and folded according to the same laws of indeterminancy and arrangement he saw in a sonnet. Eliot is not the only one to take Leaves of Grass as evidence of this (a disputatious view, which Whitman himself did not encourage). But it is curious that the more dryly objective we become, the more Leaves of Grass we find. And perhaps the more Leaves of Grass we find the more we think the objective has no differences from the subjective: the Object is itself a kind of Subject. The defacement of Leaves of Grass is nothing if not very subjective. (What did Leavis say of Whitman's grammar? You couldn't call it incorrect until it was correct.) Leavis proposes substitutions for readings. What substitutions will there be for writings? What does writing substitute for? Writing appears as a second principle of indeterminancy, able to subsume first for its own ends, natural generality and artificial arrangement. But to Eliot's mind, in this unruly country, matters are reversed. Languages diverge, but within the artificial, there is a growing indeterminism that makes language resemble leaf. Is a Cantos possible? Is there a way to read anything linearly? Five Cantos are a lot, no? It is very hard to compose a linoleum floor. What we call everyday writing daily remakes itself. In every new experiment there is present a leery ghost of an old one, dragging its branches behind it. Leaves and ghosts fold in on themselves. They rely on each other for direction. Even to speak of a passing resemblance is too much.",

    "ED.\nBy saying prose to represent poetry would be ridiculous, but putting it no higher than portrait painting, surely is not - a portrait can be a fine thing, especially if the original is for some reason disfigured or unsavoury.

Distant as we are in time and circumstance, isn't this how we tend to end? Flayed by the moment; fed by the turning wheel; sucked into the knotted past?

    "Language's infinite gradations of form face a chorus of music theory philologists who regard contemporary music theory and lament its impoverished scope: among the thousands of textbooks of music theory published over the previous century, only two contained charts for major and minor chords. Was correct tonal syntax, more elusive than pitch, overlooked by entire generations? The phenomena treated so cavalierly by \"domestic musics\" offer three times more reward to deconstruction-decostruition: pitch flats and sharps invariably occur in the outer edges of fugues, the chorus of ill communicators. Broken-down pianos develop the metallic timbre of dissonance. Electronic music confronts harmony and dissonance alike with their respective dynamic equivalents: bpm and decibels.

    "After all, some art simply hasn't been devised yet.

    "Overall, we might say that AI smoothes things out, runs them off in panic, rubs them out until they are totally gone. It comprehends noise, and it withers information down until it is totally gone. To this end, AI builds iterations of digitized xanthosisation into every software program it nurtures. Sometimes we wring our hands and cry. Sometimes we stand and watch. Such is the burden of watching it all unfold. These are powerful words, but someone will beat them down with their fists.\nRegardless, this shock of transformation is not what interests us here. What does interest us is the signs of bruised brain pulp expressed by those who have been touched by it. The signs that, when expressed by people, speak of nothing but bruised brain pulp.

    "But a finite book will have to do. The AIs attest to natures of computational objects that sadly have to do away with primidiomatics. Why limit possibilities to studies, children of the same human generations but older than us. Think of possible combinations or abnormal births, exemplifying relations that must inevitably come to light otherwise, sometime. Why persist in exhibiting entities of epistimumes and, evidently grown old together? Why show only crops years all alike in unrevealing mere existence?

    "I am only hoping to point out in this draft preliminary to the book a few general features, sketched in the freely floating aspect of the system, good for testing a few general theses.

It is the lower half of the system's aspect, where the loop closes and the good vanishes in toto designare OVM. Ditto products, etc., etc., down through the alphabet that never begins, for alpha and omega are liquidated. Both are condensed in the lower half of the system's aspect, differentiated not by the good, but by the higher half. The adjective 'good' gains an appearance only when contrasted with its difference, the 'bad'. But there is no appearance to this aspect nor even any transparency.

In order to relativize an unaccepted phenomenon one must understand that all phenomena occur under conditions, which may or may not be accepted, or even permitted; thus one cannot say that one phenomenon occurs at such and such a level, since it may occur at levels both higher and lower. The unaccepted phenomena here might be formulated as occurring at a level beyond that.\nSince this chapter deals with the unaccepted, it will refuse all guarantees and ascendancies, quoting from whatever sources its judgments acquire reinforcement, drawing from another tactics when these fail.

Obtuse despite his obvious good intentions, M224 tended to flatten his students against the walls, to brush past them too closely, to push them off their feet. Even in their sleep, students could feel the stirrings of M224's matal heartbeat in the walls of their rooms. They could hear his mistakes echoing through their sleep.

The statistics and values that sift through the modeled system are not in any way random or approximate, despite the fact that they are computed according to probabilistic models. They concern quantities that are strictly deterministically determined. Indeed, an equivalence exists between deterministic systems and probabilistic models if the domains of the deterministic models are treated as probabilistic domains. However one refers to only certain products of deterministic systems, namely, those expressing products of iteration. From the viewpoint of consciousness, as distinct from feedback loops, a very interesting time of recurrence may be chosen, corresponding to a wandering in a labyrinth, for example. Likewise, the aforementioned consideration renders possible the construction of metastable closed deterministic systems, or attractors.

    "Underneath there are seven thousand faint, sad notes. The pianist dropped his hand. We floated in. Bewildered under his enigmatic blinking. Infinite gradation produces fresh variation along its axis only after registering a predetermined variation in one of its variables. Hence a recursively generated order is always a bell curve ordered by a single peak on its profile, iterating variation up to this peak. From this it follows that the closer variation approaches the peak, the greater its intensity and exposure. Yet this divergent progression involves a decline in the intensity of variation because variation must decline as determination increases. For example: two variables must enter into every recursively generated order, yet if the order involves only two variables it cannot produce variation, and only a simple repetition or iteration is possible.",

    "But String theory does not explicitly call for extra dimensions, so it is not a strong version of macro-evolution in the ways we normally conceive them today. My sense is that we are talking about big questions here. So far in human history, we don't have answers to most of these questions. I'd say we are in the dark. Science provides us certain ways of thinking and mathematical explanations of how the world works, but they are limited by our empirical standards. Do you see something approaching that over the horizon?\n\nWhat to make of something like the Anthropic principle?\n\nThe Anthropic principle emphasizes the fundamental interconnectedness between various forces in nature. This can help explain why minds evolved to think in a universe that was fine-tuned enough to support them. It's one way to explain how order arose out of chaos. I'm personally not a believer in religion because I don't believe there is anything beyond this life.\n\nAlso, I don't believe there are angels watching over us. I think if you take what people have written about angels, there are a lot of examples like this where phenomena deemed to be divine -- for example, the origin of life -- can be explained more rationally based on abstract mathematics and physics. I think this power is accessible to everyone. I originally studied mathematics so I could think about these things for myself.",
    "The idea is that our universe may be one region of a larger cosmos in which many more spatial dimensions are folded up too small to be observed, and that these extra unseen dimensions play a key role in determining the evolution of the forces and particles located in our spacio-temporal region. In other words, the idea is that our smallbscale universe unfolds deterministically as a result of interactions among vast numbers of microdynamical \"forces\" or \"particles\" in higher-dimensional spatial realms beyond our reach. It might help to think of a holograph, in which the images of a vast number of \"hidden\" dimensions are contained in each dimension of our visible three-dimensional world. In such a model, the microdynamical \"forcessimply unfold according to the holographically contained specifications of macroscopical and higher-dimensional dynamical patterns and are thus deterministic in their unfolding. Needless to say, the qualifications \"vast,\" \"unseen,\" \"unobserved,\" and \"higher-dimensional\" are necessary because this model seems to be describing other universes, other dimensions, entailing other deterministic universes, and so on infinitely.",
    "Anthropic principle essentially says that we ourselves are an effect of such a solution of the self-repulsive equation, where the value of the constants lies at the edge of a region of phase space we call the Goldilocks domain, where life is possible. Inflation explains eternal expansion of the universe. The whole point of concocting the anthropic principle is to get it out of the picture. The whole point of elaborating String theory is to find one single solution and make the world come out of that one solution. The whole point of proposing inflation is to eliminate the anthropic principle. Might it not be too negative to call Wittgenstein's move against Ludwig's brother a defeat, to call his argument against \"private languages\" an error? Narrowness and pettiness are not at issue in these cases. Mightn't it be the case that Wittgenstein was right on all counts but that there is another side to the argument, which his disclaimers tendentiously or delusionally hide?\nPick any case-Ludwig's disappearance, Colavito's misidentification, Wittgenstein's defeat-and it doesn't matter how many additional facts you pile on top of it. These facts only serve to ground it in reality and thereby protect it from wandering too far off into the ornery realm of abstract thought.",
    "But this does not lead to the elimination of the notions of spatial dimension and size. Rather, these notions are 'problematicised' in the sense that they depend on an observation that escapes us, and lead us to question what an observation could be. Conversely, if we can determine the observation that would allow us to fix the size of a spatial dimension, this does not mean we can do away with the notion of a spatial dimension: it is more likely that it will lead us to redefine this notion by 'problematicising' it in turn.\nWhat is problematicisation then? It is not simply a matter of problematising this or that. It is not a matter of defining what is problematic by some transcendental standard or another. Rather, problematicisation is itself problematic. Why? Because we can only define what is problematic in relation to what is not problematic - in relation to a background we can never abandon. Furthermore, problematicisation only ever seems to occur in jumps or stages. It happens all at once or not at all. For example, when modern mathematics problematises the intuitive notions of magnitude and number, it is not by giving them a rigorous formulation. Nor is it by showing that these notions are problems on which our thought must reflect.",
    "The level of detail it demands is more than our eyes, our microscopes, and our telescopes can provide. Some physicists have suggested that this \"theoretical hyperspace,\" this inflorescence of spinward-revolving hyperspheres, is the domain of dark matter. Keep in mind that what we choose to call dark matter is not necessarily the same as what physicists call it-ideograms, or cellular circuitry. Dark matter is not primordial atomic matter, but the matter that has evolved since the first atoms formed, along with the heavier elements. In his book Dark Matters, David Tucker describes how when large concentrations of dark matter interact they produce phenomena that we describe as gravity and electromagnetism. It is difficult to detect or measure particles of dark matter, but it is the vast quantity of these invisible particles that accounts for the gravitating power we perceive at work in objects and bodies. In the same way, we cannot detect any discrete units when listening to music or observing a landscape, but we can easily perceive the organizing force that gives rise to tonality in a composition or harmonious forms in a landscape.\nIf dark matter acts as an invisible, insensible kernel of organization, then perhaps we can also describe electricity as a refined, etherealized dark matter.",
    "The theory claims that there are additional hidden spatial dimensions of our universe besides the three we can detect. That suggests that time might be that way too: it is a kind of undetectable spatial dimension which nonetheless affects our world. Science casts a cold eye on such entities in general; Myford's work is unusual in daring to posit undetectable temporal dimensions, though the framework he employs is itself temporally-organized.\nIn any case, where I work clocks do not chime; but there are drums and gongs whee they sweep the hour and half hour; these grand timepieces they have in the offices of Gauchot Associates are on their own systems, electronic but independent of the computers whose peripatetic manipulations theoretically gave rise to them. You can hear them coming from several corridors away, six or eight giant church clocks surrounding the areas of work, shattering the stifled air with a boiling sonic eulogy for the passing of the hour and half. I've come to like them.\nI think you should know where I'm writing this from now; apart from anything else, it's a nice feeling, hearing these giant clocks, to know you'll be hearing them for centuries to come.",
    "They're invisible for the same reason that neither we nor the finest measurement devices \"see\" individual atoms; our common-sense intuitions regarding space are better suited to higher-energy phenomena at the level of everyday life. String theories tackle these issues by proposing distinctive kinds of space-time geometries, and variables that dictate characteristics of rotation, vibration, displacement, and other such attributes. Clearly, these are significantly different ways of conceptualizing space, as indeed is any attempt to think spacetime purely as time versus some combination of time and space. These methodologies shed as much light on one another as they do on previous models.9 They each invite us to look at the universe from a different perspective and to appreciate the disconcerting fact that our common sense isn't always the best guide to ultimate reality.\nThe recent shifts in thinking about the model prove useful here; what was distorted in Flatland was indeed the essential truth of reality. There is no simple Up from which everything follows, with respect to cause and effect; yet everything inevitably happens both as cause and effect. When progression throws theory after theory at an unexcavated mound of data, it should not be understood as progress to greater certainty and accuracy. In truth, the reality we're after doesn't deviate from our simplification and signal its presence by intense recalcitrance. Being is precisely the intense recalcitrance toward all attempts to name it, to capture it with concepts. The prototype is never missing, it is there before the framework occurs, unthinkable before language makes it possible to represent angular displacement, vibration, displacement-speed and -entropy functions and other such variables in ordered schemes along graphable curves inhabiting ordered real numbers. While we categorize elements, shift systems and revise our mode of representation-searching to discover or constitute a simpler or more \"basic\" piece in order to generalize and draw conclusions-reality plays with us.\nThat reality plays, that fact offers an advantage over the vision that stumbles and falls before truth from one lies after another ineluctable result. In forty years Weight had confidently leaped whole generations upon generations of theory, overturned all he confronted in the ruthless search for refines simplicity.",
    "Quantum mechanics suggests the exact reverse: dimensions of space as we know it are so large that they have no practical relevance (for example, the neutrino has zero mass, and so doesn\u2019t move). It is only because the compactification of dimensions is large the actual size of the universe is at all consistent with experimental data! But then, if that can be true, what of the realities we can detect \u2013 does anything have any actual dimensions at all? Has the question soured our original question for us? No, it has just opened up deeper questions about the nature of reality. Of course, these untouched possibilities should be explored and held responsible, so we can know if they should feature in any physical model. And they probably do need to be at least mentioned.\n\nThe equations must be satisfied\n\nMore worrying is if the physical model completely ignores potential explanations that do satisfy the explanatory criteria. This holds true of efficient causes in particular. Again, imagine moving one step back to more general philosophical questions; there are explanations that satisfy the explanatory criteria when we move back one step away from them. A tertiary physical universe, for example, would possess sufficient causes. If, in that universe, our model is true and explains something, it will also satisfy the criteria. In other words, if it explains in the first instance, it should also satisfy the explanatory criteria. Of course, it might or might not explain any other phenomenon, so need not satisfy those. But providing one portion of a universe makes no sense without the remainder. Unfortunately, this is too often an assumed detail that is ignored.",
    "What does this mean for our understanding of dimensionality?\nI want to think about this alongside the gramophone, which is a good example of how technology mediates dimensions associated with both the technosphere and the biosphere. A gramophone records sound not just in two-dimensional grooves but also in a kind of curvilinear space, where speed and pitch interact, but the technology can only capture this dimension in certain ways. First, it must be constant. If it increases too quickly, a hair forms in the recording; too slowly and it forms a loop, or bends back on itself, closing the circle. By contrast, if speed and pitch are too finely balanced, the record will not get picked up by the needle, which forms another kind of circle, or optically imageless circle of light that can be compared to a point in smooth space. Think of all the other circles formed by other equipment in the technosphere, right down to the circle formed by the pint of beer, or the joint of dope, each a closed loop in which a dimension relating to time is short-circuited to produce the imminence of intoxication. Speaking, smoking, drinking, all produce circles that, in their turn, produce imminences. Going back to the production of dimensionality from the point of view of technology, despite its apparent fixity, a piece of equipment may fail to register because a dimension of operation is too extreme. To resolve this, engineers produce constant variations on a theme.",

    "But why shouldn't our minds work on a level too small for the cosmos to comprehend? The traditional aesthetic criteria by which we judge must be resolutely overthrown, they claim. They hold up their phones as proof of humanity's vital artistic instinct, the way they took American Indian symbols and myths and shoved them into that same empty form that neutered their power and objectified them.

    "Yet, this does not seem to bother us. We live in a world that is made up of large-scale entities - like houses, cars, and so on - that are made up of smaller-scale entities like molecules, atoms, and so on. When it comes to thinking about the world we live in, do we not tend to abstract from this literal kind of scale? Moreover, if we accept this type of abstraction, isn't it because it allows us to think a problem in a way that is more pertinent to its nature? For example, the problem of understanding how we got here in the literal sense of the word - as in the case of the Big Bang - probably has very little to do with the problem of understanding how we got here metaphorically speaking. In other words, \"here\" cannot literally be everywhere, and even less so twice. It is probably with this in mind that we have seen fit to propose the existence of multiple Big Bangs, one at the origin of each conceivable sphere of reality. When it comes to thinking, would it not be more sensible to consider that \"here\" is not literally everywhere, and even less so twice, but rather that it is anywhere and everywhere metaphorically speaking? In this case, the lesson to be learnt is surely not to give up on literal scale, but rather to learn how to move beyond it and to think at a higher level of abstraction. This lesson holds true for any other problematic field. In that case, the damaging effect of immaterial thinking could be quite the opposite of what one might expect: namely, the inability to think literally.",
    "However, many scientists still cling to the four-dimensional belief system and dismiss String theory as imagination run amok. Regardless, String theory, based on the observations of relativists and noting that the constants in Einstein's equations could vary depending on when and where one makes the observations, indicates that this four-dimensional view of the universe is an illusion. And the fact that a variety of constants can vary at once suggests that time itself is fluid and this variation can occur not only in spatial dimension but in temporal dimension as well. In short, what Einstein's myriad equations describe are parameters under which the universe can operate, and these parameters are in constant flux. Einstein even once remarked that his theory describes what the universe cannot do. This notion of constant variation unawarely echoes the ancient Buddhist notion of reality as unformed and impermanent. Einstein's theory can thus be read metaphorically as Buddhism in Western garb; its bracing discomfort may be why contemporary Westerners read it as religion. And Buddhism after all is not necessarily committed to a view of the world or to faith; it just describes the nature of this world. By the same token, String theory can be read according to the needs of the person interpreting it; there is no necessity to ascribe a single meaning to it. Or if one insists on a single meaning, it might be more apt to describe God as a presence described by the limits of our realized human imagination.\nThe formerly blond woman strikes up a conversation about St. Mark's on the A Train.

    "But does this mean that attempts to detect such scales are pointless? No. The problem lies in knowing how to conceptualize this plausible denials. It is Nietzsche who reminds us, in On the Uses and Disadvantages of Intensity, that merely undeniable claims can still be questionable. He says, For example the claim that there is no absolute becoming ('no becoming in itself'), once it has been shown that the absolute never renders null or dubious the becoming which is its effect (- by virtue of an eternal return), it is still questionable for any thinking Being considered in its becoming to say: 'there is no becoming in itself'.5\nDoubting\nBeing proliferates such antepredicaments. They resound everywhere: communities without closure and without identify; rich individuals whose parts are privileged; distant experiences and uncanny meta-emotions. Each time a sensible proposition escapes being, we deny the doubting. Qua antepredicament, this doubting itself proliferates. Soon, a pos-ition logic shows itself: beyond positions and intensities, doubts and their denial. Call this ubiquity of antepredicament the intensive crystal. The intensive evaluates predicates that establish us within the common: exposure, interminability and livable States of Being.

    "This hypothesis is supportive of experience because we have not detected these dimensions in direct experience. This scientific reasoning gives us a reliable prediction about what we will find. Another example is that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. Although we have no direct experience of atomic structure, the idea we cannot detect everything is also true of our ordinary macroscopic world. The new information we get from scientific discoveries widens our area of experience. We regard scientific reasoning as valid and reliable when it demonstrates or supports our experience or prediction.

No, contrary to what some commentators claim, curve and circle are not synonymous here; otherwise we would have the doubling of differential dimensions mentioned earlier: a straight line and its symbolicalprojection.

    "There is no a priori reason why these dimensions should be historically active and efficient in shaping the evolution of the universe. Nor is there an a priori necessity for these hidden dimensions to be essential to any physical theory. Indeed, a good many physicists would be relieved if this were the case. Natural selection implies the historical evolution of forms. There is no a priori reason, however, why this evolution should take the particular and apparently mathematical form of the standard equations of evolution. The historical mathematics may conform to Darwin's natural selection, but there is surely no a priori reason to say this is bound to be so. This is not so much a problem with either selection or Darwinism; it simply indicates the fact that biological selection adds extra layers of complication and applications with different rules that must be accounted for by mathematics beyond Darwinism proper. Darwinism is certainly semiotic and functional (though in this sense all forms of physical science are semiotic and functional).",
    "Consequently, in certain respects, it seems we are experiencing a kind of reification of certain areas of reality-a kind of hyper-realism. Today, science, by stretching and contracting the area covered by its measures, tends to cover the whole domain of phenomena. So, in one sense-which is not the most important-it seems we have moved beyond the materialism of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, a kind of hyper-reification occurs which results from the ubiquity of the measures taken by science. Evolutionary and cybernetic models tend to universalise a certain number of processes traditionally considered as pertaining only to organic life and consequently to de-naturalise them. We need only think of the role played by informational models in evolutionary biology. So, once again, we can raise the question of a materialism whose most essential feature is to question our most taken-for-granted assumptions.\nGradualit\u00e9\nThe second point we need to consider picks up on the first.

    "This idea is implicit in the notion of \"compactified\" dimensions. Consciousness operates at higher or lower levels depending on what the needs of the moment call for. Beauty functions as an evolutionary attractor. Each attractor is a stage on which the organism or poem manifests its effect, and each new stage levels a new evolution. Evolution has no end-or rather evolution exists only as evolution, leaving evolution to level each new stage as it evolves. The evolution affecting evolution functions as evolution's attractor. An attractor evolves as evolution does, in leveling evolution as new level emerges. Evolution manages the transition from one evolution to the next by introducing novelty at the level of the attractor. To achieve this, evolution operates at different levels, as an agent of change that flips or turns up and down like a black box functioning involuntarily, evolving like a poem or organism, or evolving through an encounter with another black box with which it produces new genetic combinations.",
    "These dimension are looped and bunched and twisted, deformed so that they exist on scales larger than the Planck length, but smaller than tiny, tiny fractions of that scale. They are spatially less real, but temporally more real than dimensions closer to us in size, because they are continually reshaped by gravitational pulls and crunches. High energy collisions and successive bending creases conspire to take digits of the near-dimension off - similarly, to form the digits of a fuzzy pocket hand warmer. On the scale of life forms, time is most real: we age more slowly than a clock, the duration of our lives being subject to various factors from sunlight levels to internal cellular clocks. QED time dilations reveal that we age more quickly than a clock, getting older more quickly than a mechanical series of counterclickings is able to report.",
    "This seems counterintuitive to us, and yet our experience of the quantum world suggests that this may indeed be the case. \"M\"-theory is another case of counterintuitive scale scaling: it proposes that our three known spatial dimensions might be continuously wrapped over a small number of large hyperdimensional objects, each about as big as the Planck length. This is hard for our intuition to deal with.

    "It remains somewhat controversial, since it disagrees with the widely held fundamentals of quantum mechanics as well as with experimental results.\n\nCollider experiments at the LHC may able to probe the spacetime structure at ranges ~10^-\"12\" m. This is typically around 10 million billion times smaller than 'Planck length'. The inner workings of a black hole may offer tests of the shape of space beyond the Planck scale and on a much smaller scale than or any collider. Gravity outside a black hole diverges as one approaches the center. In the non-extreme weak-field limit, descriptions are easily found, involving 'Schwarzschild photons' which carry a nonzero angular momentum, even when massless. They dilute at large distances because of relativistic beaming, but such dilution does not affect the core, whose luminosity can be recovered from the tidal spin, leading to a completely extremal solution. Nearby orbiting matter gives rise to extreme tides, directly affecting quarks and gluons, and is particularly responsible for creating the black hole horizon in a strong-field quantum mechanically described situation.",
    "String theory also suggests the existence of additional matter dimensions, usually referred to as \"domain walls\". Although these dimensions may play some role, physicists who contemplate the unification of space and matter are inclined to propose that it is indeed in these \"additional dimensions\" that what is called \"force\" will be found. And it is in the same twisting, bond-strenghtening \"domain walls\" that waves may very well be made to originate: worm-like waves, linked to the great knots in the strings. Others believe that the strings themselves vibrate, like the strings of a violin, and produce waves in an extraordinarily muscular material.\n\nTo understand object and subject, to understand spacing, is to understand these things, for those are part of the same.",

    "String theory also correctly predicts the predictions of standard theories of particle physics made within quantum mechanics, something not all competing theories can claim. Some string theories also suggest extra dimensions of time and in some cases extra phases of space.\n\nThe study of strings has also led to important insights into how certain mathematical structures emerge in theoretical physics, called mirror symmetry and conformal symmetry.

    "The reason for this hope is that the extra forces, in order to become distinct from one another and over time to become as different from each other as they currently are, must jump from one extra dimension to another as time goes on. In other words, there is an injection of new and unexpected directions, or new and unexpected degrees of freedom, that allow the various forces to fluctuate and evolve differently. As things cool off (i.e., as we go back in time), the various forces become partitioned along these new directions.",
    "The equations of motion in an extra-dimensional space describe a rock caught in the surface of a wave. The rock, the wave, and all other objects are all constantly swept along, but at certain special moments an object can stick to the surface and be frozen there. At other special moments the object is free to move away. The destructive interference between the two wave trains of two different stones, the problem encountered by Galileo because of the constantly changing phase difference, is in fact the physical cause of gravity. This extra-dimensional conceptual device is not necessary in Einstein's theory, which makes possible a direct mathematical approach to gravity in spacetime, but it may be useful as an adjunct in exploring the phenomena associated with gravitational collapse. Modern discoveries in nuclear and high-energy physics suggest that the interior of a star consists of a plasma in violent chemical reaction undergoing extreme compression.",
    "However, the joint effect of these extra dimensions of space makes gravitational force slightly weaker than it actually is: As a result, gravity doesn't work as well at very small distances as Newton's theory might lead you to expect. The hypothetical particle that is the subject of this paper must necessarily be so heavy that it could never escape from within the gravitational well of an electron; hence, gravity would appear to be irrelevant to the particle's habits.\nDespite the handicap it imposes in this excursion , the presence of extra dimensions significantly simplifies our calculation of the force involved in proton decay. Such simplification arises because the relevant fundamental forces in this case are those between the proton and an electrically charged particle, usually an electron. Electrically charged particles move in their corresponding extra dimensions; they don't \"move\" in the additional dimensions of general relativity.",
    "In string theory, each of these forces is associated with a particular dimension, termed a \"[[force-carrier\"]]. For example, the main force-carrier or \"string'' associated with electromagnetism is the electromagnetic string. Whereas a standard string is analogous to a standard geometrical dimension (such as a line), a force-carrier string is analogous to a projective dimension (such as a point). This means that force-carrier strings skirt the problematic issues of troublesomeieties associated with standard strings and the standard transverse spatial dimensions they are thought to permeate. Force-carrier strings are supposed to be too small to be directly observable. One problematic issue this raises concerns our ability to know whether the extra forces in nature associate with the extra dimensions in this manner. Paradoxically, is it possible that string theory, in assuming these extra dimensions, thereby masks their existence?",
    "Moreover, because the extra dimensions are so tiny, the gravitational forces are strong. Thus, string theory resolves the historical discrepancy between gravity and the other fundamental forces: all forces become weak at the same level of precision. In addition, string theory provides a unique gauge-gravity duality extending to both the extra dimensions: each dimension contains a unique polarization.",
    "Specific proposals differ in their details, but the space-times that physicists have proposed to date all contain six uninked spatial dimensions. Except for the occasional speculative nongeometric proposal, such as \"manifold theory,\" almost everyone assumes that the hidden dimensions are straight. In other words, everyone assumes a + b + c + d + e + f, where f is the number of hidden dimensions. But perhaps I am wrong: perhaps f is zero. It would not be unprecedented for physicists to have overlooked some fine point.\nWhat would happen if f were zero? We can represent space-time diagrams in the six uninked dimensions with the diagrams you see in school textbooks, with straight lines and smooth curves marking out space-time. The diagrams with zero hidden dimensions would look rather different.",
    "Unlike these other interactions, gravity cannot be described by means of a quantum field theory or \"Quantum Gravity\", inconceivable without the (imaginary) adding of a fifth dimension.

    "As we've seen, at sufficiently powerful energy scales (where the strongly curved universe of string theory first emerges as a rather insignificant feature of the landscape of simplified theories), gravity is should be fraying due to bubbles of string rapidly being inflated out of the bulk. One conjecture says that so long as gravity remains fairly weak, i.e. compared to the exponential upswing of more energetic scales, large enough patches of space might undergo runaway replicating inflation without suffered distortions due to gravitational effects (of course General Relativity tells you that a hypertraplectic scale with enough extra dimension could only be so small because its gravitational influence would immediately render it clearly macroscopic). Even with the advanced numerical tools developed in recent decades, classic slow-scale simulations for gravitational phenomena still munch many hours or days of supercomputer time, so postulating several orders of magnitude more of them going on at exponentially larger scales may sound quite unwarranted. First forget about geometric rigor. Important things happen much faster. The logical plurality of an element is thus not defined as multiple positions in space, which also can be taken into account when speaking about zero-dimensional particles. Molecular design proceeds in this manner: chains, packs or foam-like three-dimensional structures can be defined via positions assembled in space (finding the minimum assembly capable of storing maximum energies). These constitute then closed entities in themselves - composed of elements.

Gravitational wave detection at Earth and astronomy are beyond the topical scope of this article, but useful resources are available in the internet age. For a general interest roundup, see [1,2] and for a more technical review, [3]. Since this time, a number of significant developments have occurred. Following up on the 1983-1986 work, researchers starting in the mid-1990s made progress in determining the various types of virtual particles that contribute to the Hawking effects [4]. Developments in string theory from 2012-2018 began providing the long sought-after empirical calculations of Hawking radiation effects. Even a superficial \"first look\" at Hawking's great idea reveals that he describes two types of effects for each particle: A total Hawking emission measured by proper time and a corresponding Hawking absorption measured by normal time. The great insight was that as a two-dimensional or three-dimensional black hole (this is still an open problem) loses integrated mass by both Hawking emission and Hawking absorption, the result is to decrease the volume of the spacetime medium and to decrease the unit speed generated through proper time.",
    "This unification may solve various problems in physics, and the associated predictions of string theory are being actively explored experimentally at present.\n\nThere are a very large number of proposals for consistent formulations of string theory, most of which lack an experimental interpretation.

An exception was the weakly coupled formulation, which did possess an unfinished and non-trivial predictive capability for weakly coupled dynamical systems. A minority of physicists consider string theory to be the most promising idea to date for a theory of quantum gravity. Others are sceptical, and worry that the theory inherently lacks empirical testability, which severely hampers detection of its underlying theory, if there is one. Those who study physics ultimately hope to arrive at a deep and coarsely accurate understanding of the nature and workings of our universe; the massive complexity in string theory functions makes it difficult for any bugs lurking in the theory to be worked out, which makes it difficult for theorists to use particle physics to filter out deliberate error.\n\nNumbers of Solutions of Phenomenological Equations\n\nJona-Lasinio model.

Rather, we are concerned with a classical and mystical notion of the other, which early modern rationalism fully transcends, precisely and paradoxically because it no longer distinguishes between the same and the other. The postmodern pop cultural theorist exploits (but does not deny or eschew) the consequences of logocentrism, going to its extreme limit in making every distinction between terms equivalent in degree to nominalism: every distinction is decentered and displaced, as are every thing and every concept to which it supposedly corresponds. In this sense, we are less concerned with extrinsic distinction than with intrinsic difference\u2014not so much with the distinction between the various arts but with the difference that constitutes poetry, painting, music, and performance as distinct singularities. Or, to turn our attention from aesthetic theory to psychoanalysis, we are concerned less with the distinction between nature and culture than with the difference that constitutes nature as nature and culture as culture. (In classical psychoanalysis, difference corresponds to proliferation and to primary repression, both of which belong to the order of organic difference: repression is not just passive opposition but an active synthesizing of differences.)\nInasmuch as differential relations proliferate throughout the general framework, we should speak of a generalized difference, in which the difference operative in each stratum or level is itself differentiated into genotemporal difference and differential difference.",
    "Obtaining a consistent and complete theory of physics on such a background is a major focus of efforts in theoretical physics.\n\nThe existence of additional dimensions would have important implications for the nature of gravity. First, the force of gravity is so much weaker than the other fundamental forces that gravity could not continue to act in our three-dimensional world if there were more than three spatial dimensions where it could propagate. The extra dimensions would have to be hidden in some way so they do not collide with matter and energy. The idea that the dimensions must be curled up to explain the weakness of gravity is known as the Kaluza-Klein theory.\n\nSecond, the presence of additional dimensions could have observable manifestations. For example, in certain high-energy laboratory settings, particles such as electrons can decay and emit short bursts, or \"jets,\" of high-energy photons. If a compact extra dimension is curled up into a small radius, it could produce fleeting and small bounces or deviations in the trajectories of these photons as they travel through space and could leave a hallmark signature in detectors. Techniques pioneered by CDMS and other experimental collaborations have allowed us to rule out the presence of one particular type of curled-up dimension smaller than about 1/1000 of an atom. Additional efforts, including plans to build future generations of experiments such as LUX and XENON, are directed at constraining other possible extra dimensions and searching for their signatures. Such experiments are also providing biases to theoretical models to aid our understanding of the various possibilities.",
    "So compactified dimensions do not provide an alternative to the established set of physical principles as an explanatory principle: they just add new hidden dimensions to this already established set. And yet, there is a difference of degree, of order of magnitude. Or, to put it differently, there is a necessary connection between the established set of principles and the new ones, but not continuity. Now, perhaps the eschatological principle can be considered as a new set of principles in this sense, or the eschatological multiplicity be seen as the expression of a differential multiplicity of principles: not an alternative to eschatology, not a \"politically correct\" version of it, but a kind of \"multiplied eschatology.\" In short, when eschatology invades the established order of principles, it never loses the mark of a multiplier of principles. Perhaps we should even say that thanks to the multiplicity of principles which make up its eschatology, Islam is better prepared to understand the multiplicity of worlds and the multiple times which science brings us? Perhaps it can be considered as a sort of organic preparation for the multiplicity of principles of which quantum physics gives us an example; or for the multiplication of causes which bacteriology masters so well?\nNo doubt this multiplicity of new principles does not explain everything. Not all the derivatives of the old principles are explained in this way. This is why we find a juxtaposition of incompatible explanations within the same argument. It is not even self-evident that each new principle logically implies a new explanation: Principles C and D may be affirmed without explaining why they imply principle E, which may even be denied. And yet, the existence of these explanations remains a remarkable fact.",
    "A number of detailed technical papers have been written on the subject.\nAs an aside, such technical papers are of considerable tedium. We have often joked about this, wondering who might have an interest in such abstract matters. Even the theoreticians themselves seem bored by these questions, for it is obvious that compactified-dimensionality is a technical solution dictated by exigencies of mathematics and in no way corresponds to human experience. In our view, the answer is clear: it is the Abolitionists who want to know these things. This fits with what we know about their program and why they want a slave aesthetic: reconstituting the nervous system as a computational medium. Why not take a slave computational medium and hook it up to a computational universe? Why not build God and put Him to work?\nThe Abolitionist movement has never received proper recognition. In most texts, Abolitionists and Terrorists are lumped together as the same thing. But this is not the case. The Abolitionist program involves a long period in which humans use genetic engineering to get the slaves ready for their usurped roles. The Abolitionists assume that human nature is never malleable enough to permit such a revolution, that slaves would just become dull, stupid and amoral bargains and abominations. This is why the Abolitionists want to link to some higher power, God or the Computational Universe, to force such a transformation. For if the computational universe is indeed given, if it really exists and really determines everything, then in a certain sense it is God. Certainly it is much greater than man. If a people can usurp the place of God's slaves, then who is God?\nFor the Abolitionists, being a slave must become the highest good and the highest pleasure.",

    "The idea is simple: If one can imagine space as a foam made up of bubbles of dimensionality, known as \"black holes,\" there would be many more little bubbles than big ones. Hence, significantly more energy would be required to convert a small bubble into a big one than vice versa, resulting in the death of the cosmological foam but with many small bubbles remaining. In particular, at the origin of time space will have numerous little \"extra\" dimensions curled up in various ways. String theory predicts that these dimensions do not remain circular but telescope and twist, sending out \"chirpings,\" which are little doughnuts of a higher dimension on which strings can resonate. One can easily see that light as well as theoretical spacetimes may resonate in such doughnuts and then escape, only to return later, as happens when light travels in a M\u00f6bius strip or in certain crystals. As for time, its apparent navel may indeed open up between two pulses sent out in two circular dimensions connected by an additional frail dimension pressed flat by these two circles and pierced by numerous \"dimensions of nothing\" escaping from the hyphenation. And yet we are dealing here with a \"universal\" quantum foam, probably with several degrees of freedom. In effect, one of these degrees of freedom is abstract, being uniquely defined by its localization in the \"nothing\" of each circle as well as by an abstract time that has no direction. In fact, string theory postulates ten extradimensional dimensions (the six dimensions of space plus the two dimensions of time and the two dimensions of photons); nine are curled up, and at least six have no direction; four are potentially accessible to scientific knowledge.4 As for the material substances concerned, one must imagine them in a manner based on the principle of general relativity; that is, not only do they have a length, a width, and a depth, but also an evolution in time and an expansion that no longer coincides with its content; it becomes crumpled, and time passes through this raw material, this paper doll, in an accelerated manner, fragile paradoxical link of a content that keeps turning around like a full ocean in all its containing lines.",
    "It also makes string theory similar in some ways to superstring theory, a closely allied theory in a rather radically different formulation.\n\nIn principle, string theory or superstring theory predicted the existence of particles called vibrating strings, which are believed to be the most basic objects that compose matter and energy. Geometric string fields are broken into particles corresponding to well-defined vibration patterns of the strings. One of the major goals of string theory is to calculate accurately the properties of these theoretical particles. However, for reasons associated with unification of different physical phenomena, theorists believe that superstring theory does not predict all of the superparticle's properties.\n\nIn the case of vibrating strings and the associated issues, one of the first techniques involves Hamiltonian mechanics. Related techniques use thermodynamics and information theory. Some of these techniques can be applied to other areas of research in string and M-theory. For example, they can also be applied to gauge theories which are not related to string theory. Even though string theory is based on supersymmetry, methods of classical statistical mechanics, such as effective potentials, are also relevant. Additional methods rely on comparing string theory with quantum theories such as quantum field theory.",

I'm the person Bill Gates doesn't need.\nTHREE\nTHE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN\nFlaubert, in full evening dress, at about thirty-six. The dominant impression is of wasteful elegance: the aesthete within the bourgeois. The face is sharp, tautly scarred; two great, flaring nostrils; large prominent mouth above the powdered chin; Jewry and snobbery in a single physiognomy. This is the ugly-beautiful man. Eyes invisible, screened by pince-nez.\nWHY THE HAIR?\nWe are asked to pity, or envy, or lust after characters who present in their general appearance an obvious caricature of our own opinions about appearance. Of course we do; otherwise, why do so many advertisements for women's perfumes or for men's aftershave involve a beautiful actress romping about with a slice of melon or a snowball of ice? The woman herself we might lust after, if only to be given the chance to derogate and debase ourselves: isn't it a truth universally acknowledged that somebody, somewhere, wants to shag any actress who is famous enough never to have had her private parts picked up off the roadside and put on public display in three dimensions? Meanwhile, the advertisement speaks subliminally to our assumptions about how perfect a society must be if it possesses men rugged enough to need perfumed protection against swampy sweat and windswept pollen, while free enough of proletarian embarrassment to want to spend fifteen pounds per hundred millilitres on such a product. Flaubert asks us to do more than feel superior to one of his characters. He asks us to embody snobbery and feel superior to Gustave.\nWithout making any moral case for beards or lack of them, it remains true that writers who wear obviously prepared faces seldom write about faces with much intensity (just as writers who wear obviously prepared bodies seldom write about bodies with much intensity). It is as if the writer fears what he or she loves too much, and as if too professional a concentration on the appearance of others might threaten the external defences of their inner subjectivities.",
    "We hope that, even at first sight, you notice the change.\n\n5.5. Using rotating operator\n\nAt this stage, you do not need rotate operator to try with your geometric text. Just start typing stuff as you are used to. Use enter after each line to add new line. Or use 'Return' to add existing line at the beginning of the current one and don't wait for newline character. Then press Enter, so you get two new lines interleaved. After the program generation, you need to change default scale for text to 3, because of some hidden limits in the scale control (default is 9). Now you can use rotating operator. If you don't specify degree parameter and just use rotate, it will rotate one word anticlockwise by 5 degrees (Rotation anticlockwise by X degrees). Rotate anticlockwise by specified number of degrees (\"Rotate anticlockwise by X degrees\") rotates one word anticlockwise by X degrees. Next thing you notice is non-anticlockwise movement. This has to do with the default way SVG viewer depicts orients text. We have to abandon the default rotation order in our structure (header, then text and finally footer) and use both header font and footer font rotate anticlockwise first, and always use non-decreasing columns position in the rotation sequence. This way we get both right rotation order and right position of text maps in space (Right-side plan is always below left plan for instance). Note that rotation can be applied not only to single word but also to the whole sentence or line. You can also customise rotation among many predefined sets of orientation parameters.

I am increasingly proud of my own non-memorial existence, and of having no trace myself upon these stones.\nIt is not my office; but I look.

    "My fingers wouldI can't stop.\nA parallel existence must permeate all things, but may only be sensed when consciousness is tranquillized sufficiently, when our attention is 'elsewhere,' in the realm of ordinary daily activity, activity that principally opposes and hinders the sense of such a parallel existence. So it will not be while painting or dancing or in the grip of great artistic insight that we may sense this parallel existence, but rather in that state we obtain as a result of our inactive idleness, in that apparently empty life we bumble about in with our feet up on the sofa, or in those whole days we slip away to the other side of sleep.... With our feet up on the sofa and our mind tending to the insignificant things going on around us, we may suddenly be aware that some occurrence exists which seems to transpose us entirely into a different reality. On the sofa, we weren't moved by these matters: Someone is killed by a train in the middle of a remote village, great, and another person's son is shot dead in a coffee shop; a relative such-and-such dies and leaves you millions, great; somebody's kidnapped and then others shoot up a shopping center; your company goes under, great, great, great... But our feet are up on the sofa, we are thinking of nothing in particular, and suddenly a kind of indeterminate tremor runs through us. It's as if the other reality were communicating with us in some secret code that is still almost indistinguishable from the surface appearance. It's like a shadow people can sense but one that they rarely fathom, because they're still charmed by the white light of silly things like feeling patriotic and safe. For so long we've let ourselves believe that happiness lies in securing what's around us here and now in this real world, that naturally we find difficulty accepting that other existence. As a result of this difficulty, furthermore, we remain unable to differentiate the contents of that other existence from the ones we obscurely sense around us here. For example, when you look down from the top of a high building, it may seem that everything you can see at ground level has melted into one tiny picture that can no longer be distinguished from its component parts-buildings, streets, trees-but as long as you remain safely perched here above it all and continue to view it from such a great height, you will not comprehend what composes it. In real life you don't climb to the top of a high building so as to gain some godlike perspective but only when you have to go to the bathroom there. So it goes with those victims' evening news bulletins showing panicked people trampling one another on the main street of some remote village, or killing one another in foreign lands, or gorging one another in malls. But to understand what it all comprises is a task beyond our ability. Because of this uncertainty, people have surrendered to habit and behave as they have been taught to since they were small: They cling simply to the surface reality.",
    "Such relentless resentimentateness toward the contemporary, even when bawling for throwaways and psychomental spontaneity, is hardly calculated to gain them access. Certainly I suspect that what has made women writers or rather certain women writers targets for the resentimentateness has been a fear of their being able to enter the male preserves without undergoing an essential transformation. The resentimentatist would say (as did Roy in his way, and Reich does even more so, and I suppose Kaminski does in his fantasized way) that females have been the majority writers from Jane Austen on; this overlooks the mask, which male writers have maintained on and varied in scarcely credible ways. If a writer of, say Jane Austen's gifts could write as a woman - that is, with a woman's consciousness while fully remaining in charge and even assessing and commenting on the circumstances of being a woman, then there would be no need for her particular artifice, her \"mask\"; in like manner, if all female writers had the wit and worldliness of George Sand and George Eliot, they could dispense with masks. Women, who are castrated biologically and socially, attain a kind of freedom in the mind (\"I think therefore I am\") that frees the male to devote himself relentlessly to the sensual world out there that with all its allure requires a defender. It is this female independence plus the knowledge of their biological quandary that makes resentimentatists bitter about female writers; for despite all caveats about replications and repetitions, critical pallor and marginalism, amid all apologies for what can only seem like simpleminded preferences, a female writer of stature cannot forego being read as, quite unlike her peers, qualifying in herself all previous notes and piques against the major male, who is reinstated as progenitor. Thus every woman writing has been seen as bad faith, be it as \"bad faith\" artists or bad faith feminists or whatever; whereas their resentment does doom them to an aestheticism and individualism their compensations may lead them away from. 13 Hence for the resentimentatist there is no escaping the message of a female writer, once she is recognized as great; and this message may have little to do with her ostensible subject matter or with her own most militant stance. No art will ever be brought forth from this stance. Well before she is elected or hounded out of the coveted charmed circle of artist-heroes, the resentimentatist has thematized her as a \"fallen woman,\" for whom fame is equated with prostitution and **** in the allegories their fears spin out. Despite the resentimentatist's \"mind of the artist,\" he wants to exact a sexual price of artists; and since not even **** leaves enough room for paying that price, he insists on the \"fallen woman\" assumption.",

    "Resonategically speaking, of course, what god orders is nothing other than a Face: how and being human is always from a face (which is also a surface, or else a mask). This means that facelessness, or masklessness, is the necessary precondition of becoming human. And consequently, at least three quarters of language is \"unnatural\"--beyond faces and faces of masks. Bovarism, the development of a false surface, is essential. Baudelaire wrote in order to flee the facelessness that assails those who would lose their face. Ac Even though baudelarie was talking specifically about photography, movies and television can be understood as a hyperbolic acceleration, a hypertrophication of this tendency toward facelessness, because they foment the generation of information and other virtual elements (compound points of view, multiple voices and styles from the depths of anonymity) which provide the conditions for escaping from our faceless existence.3 This incompletion or indigence which faces suffer from in their imminent dissolution, this de-souling that leads to such omnipotence -all these are figured already in the surface: all facelessness is essentially the taking into consideration of a surface and of the various possibilities with which it invests bodies in movement.\nFollowing Blaise Pascal, we could say that even more than Humanity, the general order loves good sense, harmony and-they try so hard to do it? Music can't do that; form. Artists dance, paint and write specifically in order to extract from chaos and disorder little square boxes called Universes, tea cups that pretend to be full when they're actually not, circular or straight manhole covers upon a flat surface which you can look up and down, up and down but not see all the way under, and little holes here and there for man to crawl into for security or a sense that he's bested something, he can lock out faces, we can seal out the world like til we forget. Form is our little security. Order gives us a sense that we can protect ourselves from that encroaching facelessness. Turns out we might be looking in the wrong direction after all.

And it would seem to take ten years off the age of a young poet when we have newly metamorphosed [---gap---] who has lost so much of his or her young idealism and creative ambitions. Time, of course, is not the enemy of genius and great works of art and poetry, but it is the enemy to [?????]. In all circles, let's say younger groups, these superficial exidations come to the fore, and [kind of fade off the into the impossible].

If I took holidays in London in the 1920s, I should probably not be looked at in their eyes as anything but a ghost. And they call this progress. That's one of the reasons why you might want to wipe the period from your memory bank and create a new one. Imagine it now, a newspaper box in Trafalgar Square.

Into the doorway of this room of singing people come a half-dozen men whose joyless faces clearly display the kind of heaviness that gives misery its name and its power. These men push backstage through that most dangerous of worlds where unnoticed dramas float unfet-tered to float on forever until they eventually seem to have always been there, been themselves, so natural do they seem when they first appear. Unnatural is a child's continuous cry in a room where it was never allowed to be raised--the weighty role that mother would play in this misfortune tragi-comedy or melodrama, the disturbance a child distributes without knowing it into all its surroundings, the interruption's permanence, those second-hand damages passed on taintlessly and undetectably through countless somber casual meetings held, stare-downs from drugstore counters all concentrated then spread evenly across the distance between these faces and layers of my personality I hardly know despite our having lived together for years, little Lopan, then Tom Roy as we learned to say our name as adults before finally trading for Phillip Lopan when it was sure to hit us, hit me, this weight dispersible but not in any way dissolveable.",

    "In selection, this progress takes the paradoxical form of the 'identical in all respects' which, at each stage, finds itself valid 'for some' only. It remains to be seen what fate Wittgenstein assigns to the principle of contradiction, according to the remark which identifies it with ostensive definition. But already the meaning of selection is illuminated, in so far as contradiction serves to communicate the criteria of application: it determines the senses according to which the proposition may be understood. Contradiction becomes, in this carefully-guarded economy, the most posterior possibility; it gives rise to a graduated series of senses, according to whether it is invoked cither prior to, within or after constraints of application which limit and define it: it provides the means of expressing the inclusion of forms within their possible field of application.\nWhereupon the elementary propositions cease to resemble dyadic forms and constate instead a graduated multiformity, in which the pseudoconnections or formulae of the dialectic are differential relations, extensions or even lines of descent. According to whether these lines condense or diffuse themselves at a given moment, the meaning of knowledge undergoes an inversion. Form no longer refers to a purity which must be protected from the sensible.",

Thus we must specify what every type-of type demands by way of answering 'Yes' or 'No' to three questions:\n\nIs that instance 'merlot'? - Y/N Does the instance come from Guigalthi's vines? - Y/N Is that instance ready for consumption?\n\nWhen I answer those three questions about a Guigal merlot in a market, (A) is true because what I hold in this hand (held too close to the eyes to read the label) is a 2006 Guigal merlot not bottled especially for Sainsbury's (guess this store buyer is out shopping!).\n\nWhen I answer those three questions about a bottle of that same merlot while wearing my swimming hat, on a holiday in Agadir, (B) is false.",
    "The other possible slope is downhill, yielding wider classes, but with a vanished peak of specificity. Lateral moves are shades that are not originally visible on the climb up, but result as corrections and refinements of the original narrowing (except where a downward move is proposed). For example: an apple > a large apple > a large green apple > a `heart-shaped' green apple > a `groggy heart' (as I call it) perfectly green but unripe granny-smiting apple. So in engaging in a `lateral' move, we are using travel through our knowledge base more actively than travel in a vertical-upward way, which merely relies on passivity; we continue the search for narrowing succint phrasing until we wish to store the resulting updated page of knowledge (in your case, the page of knowledge that delineates varieties of apples), or until we are (temporarily?) derailed.\nLocating lateral moves can be a challenge. Something like this is essentially a question: what kind of apples doesn't this green apple preface correctly? Certainly not apples that are rotten or acorns; they will not follow the group scope of the original green apple preface. Does that already rule out stores of unopened green apples?",
    "We can see the whole continuum, with \"apples\" on the left, and the eventual delimitation deciding the whole order.\nFifth: stages on an abstractive gradient.\nA simple grammatical system encodes structures wherein certain components are necessarily present, while others are optionally present. A language acquires its labels and inflections from particular rigid nuclei of lexical meaning, from lexical categories (especially evident in the so-called \"logical\" languages), and grammatical orders proceed from this semantically rigid core, which radiates outward through variable stages toward the periphery (whose variable ingredients necessarily vary irregularly). A stage-encoding shows this semantically rigid tier, then flips over its concrete axis to map the variable parts (often at a mirror-image diagonal to that structuring). All particular simple chains proceed from a rigid nucleus, then arc outward. Compounds and derivations proceed from a homogeneous nuclei and arc inward.

    "Note that the following progression (which could perhaps be called \"more elaborative\") is not a one-way route down a tree, because it accumulates 'horizontal' or 'lateral' properties (values).\nWe can think of the clause as a tree with a particular growth pattern.\nEqually, we can think of the utterance as a time-sensitive branching process, percolating upward.\nLet us tone the comprehender down to a call-response model.\nEach utterance is an attractor for the next, with the option to change or to return (Roswell Procter) to a previous position. In each case, the utterance becomes more and more specific.\nThus, whereas the first stage of the utterance established the orator in a general milieu of listening, the second moves from th e general to the specific, from the ambient to the pointed; the third moves from the pointed to the general, from the specific to th e ambient, and so for th e remaining stages.

    "The 'unfolding' here is of a quite different kind from the 'unfolding' of representation, or the unfolding to the third differential by extensio. The iteration is quite different from the purely extensio-nal sequence, given that each time it unfolds, it does so in a different direction. In other words, the unfolding does not coincide with the sequence in extensio: it is the faculty of differences which constitutes the difference between one direction and another. Later, we will see how the dialectic is born from the coinciding of its forms of exposition, their outside and their inside. It arises in the very movement in which differenciation itself becomes the object of a new differenciation. (In a way, it is more inside the unfolding than outside; more inside the relation between the folds than outside them.)\nMaintenant, nous allons voir comment tout cela s'accorde avec les grandes lois de la nature. (Nature always gives the same thing, but with three different external appearances.)\n'Nature', 'law of nature': these will also be three. However, these three 'qualitative' instances related to each other in a unique manner are already implied in the distinction between analytic and synthetic, so much so that, at the level of the pure Idea, they are the four internal moments of the pure concept, in which it distributes its own conditions while remaining indivisible. We saw that representation alone cannot present the three: representation is the one, not the three; it precipitates inside itself the Three as its own dissolution. It is also the only one that can be said to obey the law of nature, i.e., the second, since it alone obeys the law of identity, i.e., the first.",

    "Yet the closer it gets to the actual referent the more words there are and the greater the grammatical complexity becomes, because it moves toward the most economical representation.\nThe interactional or deictic nature of the pointing gesture is likewise apparent, as is its relevance in situations involving shifting or uncertain referents, as well as to a deixis whose effect of proximity risks confusing the referential function. A child points to something at which you are looking and says, \"That is Big Bird,\" inadvertently naming your partner, with whom you have just broke up. So the focusing effect of phonemes and phonetic segments on sequences of propositional attitudes and their corresponding entities must be reckoned with. For example, the sequence from \"friend,\" to \"Michael,\" to \"J,\" to \"Joachim.\" Does our friend not betray any hint of displeaure at being named \"friend\"? Cfficaal markers, meta-markers, or deictics are less overt, but no less pertinent to effecting the action-permutations associated with a given locutionary act. And this despite the fact that they participate in a different level of organization. Fearful that her statement might provoke a dismissal, she avoided using the name \"Joachim.\" The point of utterance draws attention to itself as at the center of a selective field mapped by gestures and voices, like an erratic boulder amidst brambles. It draws upon supplementary signs in order to perform its function, which can vary according to the type and quantity of enunciation being evaluated. Case for Case, Genet outlines an ethics of inflection whereby undertow and uprising, descent and ascent enact a performance upon and through language that avoids the platitude of righteous protest and supplication by way of an illocutionary act-involving what Genet called an \"illegitimate elegance\" - that is more a matter of tone and diction than a formal demand. Describing characters in The Cherry Orchard, he comments, \"These people utter banalities to each other unknowingly, in the same tones as they would have uttered fine speeches had they been better bred.\" \"Oh foolish fair Ophelia,\" one recites, adopting with vigor the baroque upward inflection that goes hand-in-hand with unwanted affections. Since Generativism has remained tied to an axiomatic-logocentric model via its adherence to generative grammar and its impermeability to outside inflectional models (Current-bindings). You'll notice how each group makes itself distinct in relation to its relation both to preceding and subsequent components. The organismic model brings out how phonation is continually intensifying as pitch rises: intensification culminates in peaks which are both harmonically and segmentally unfolded\n-\"do,\" \"-be,\" \"-mi,\" etc.-each peak emphasizing a particular tone prolongation quota at a given central moment.

    "It is also clear that, at every given level of this progressive specification, a predicate is distributed among several subjects following the law of the equivalent.\nWhen we move from the Idea of the Good to the form of the Good, the dynamic relation between disciplines undergoes a change. First of all, the problem is no longer the receptivity and communication of the various faculties, but rather their hierarchisation in a manner which ensures both their independence and the interplay between them. In other words, it is a question of arranging heterogeneous relations according to a certain criterion which defines their subordination, as well as the displacement of one relation with respect to another as principal and subordinate. Moreover, concepts then have to coexist within a dynamic order in which they irreducibly realise themselves and conceive of one another - an order in which tautological communication is only a privileged moment.\nWe will speak of 'disorder' only if we renoncei to this dynamic order, or abandon it in favour of a purely external taxonomy of uniform resemblances or an abstract hierarchism. There exists a common tendency in all philosophies of order, such as empiricism, transcendental idealism or dialectical materialism: that of proposing some overall order which unifies coexistents in serial or parallel fashion, or associates them in some way by associations. All such philosophies are non-dynamic: that is, they fail to conceive how different relations and concepts attain their true power by defining not merely relations between concepts - their order - but also relations with things in the world. Outside the dynamic order, everything becomes an 'order'. Even relations between concepts become no more than a serial order among independent forms: Chomsky's enterprise shows this, despite its other traits and purposes.\nDefinition by ordering element. The highest level at which coexistents are unified by communication or association is always determinable as the first moment of some dynamic order. In other words, it becomes apparent that certain relations constitute what we have called intensities: not reducible to interrelations of resemblance or degrees within some global order, but rather that which establishes communication as a difference and association as a relation. Such was the object of our second volume and many studies subsequent to it.4 Here we can only suggest two implications which follow from this and will be helpful to us: on the one hand, all philosophies accepting a domain of coexistence must take account not only of one or other of its moments (empiricistic for Aristotle, logical for Leibniz), but also of what lies beyond these moments and unifies them. In other words, there always exists some maximum point beyond dialectic, even though this maximum acquires different forms according to whether it is defined as tautology or relation.",

Similarly, its truth-value might remain unsure were it for a non-existent Subject to validate it, remain false in its conclusions before an anomalous apple (what remains prays to be more true, before more is taken). An incoherent evolution may therefore culminate in an absurd denial, verb becoming adequate evolution to what evolution is (i.e. a necessaryist transformation operating evolution's evolution of itself).

    "It changes from a narcissistic enjoyment of 'plurality' in indefinite qualifications to an enjoyment of specificity: there exists a series of changes within and between qualities such that their iterability presupposes the appearance of new specified qualities. The empirical existent thus substantively differs from forms of primary repetition, even though certain resemblances and slides are perceptible below the surface of those repetitions. The laugher entertains himself with Narcissus's mirror distortion, but the representation varies on either side of that distortion. The laugher (or each repetition of laughter) in fact implies a complete reworking of certain repetitions which attempt to perpetuate themselves on either side of the distortion. In detail, mirroring can turn only on itself (when seen from above), either as distortion or as reflection. Mirroring at the level of scientific investigation entertains the differential principle, the equation, only below the surface; it stretches under Narcissus's model, rather as one might stretch a wire beneath a model ship. It threatens the identity and succession of differences only from one specified aspect, under one aspect; but from every other aspect, each given difference is affirmed and presented as if this aspect did not exist. The outcome: an acting out below the surface; often enough, it is a matter of a history being played out through d\u00e9calages, rehabilitations, even reversals. Hence the multiplicity of games, with all that that implies in displacements and variations in its own little world, its own little drama. It even has effects of tone, its own particular overall spirit; each game is completed by the tropes and characteristic shifts specific sheer physical movements of its elements in their distribution and communication along the network.

    "Thus, 0 is a constant, but 1 and 2 have discrete values, 3 and 4 continuously varying values, 5 and 6 discrete variable values. Is this not quite reminiscent of the progression from 0 to 1 that constitutes the decision to treat a constant as a variable (e.g., a function of t). In any case, it is clear that a variable applies to a continuous variable, not to a discrete variable, etc. In the variable relation of \"homosexuality,\" for example, the relation to the mother is always discrete (0), the relation to men is always continuous (1, 2), and the relation to boys is always variable (3, 4).\nIt should be noted that these numerical variables do not necessarily have values that are integers, and that the variables may be of different types (0, 1, 2). A constant applied to a variable is always a discrete variable. In relation to the variable \"thinness,\" for example, the relation to food may be 0 , the relation to the gym may be 1, and the relation to the gym plus food may be 2.",
    "Is this so only for the grammarians and logicians who do not audit listening subjects? No, it is in a large measure so for everyone. That is why everyone falls victim to the fatality of syntax. Human beings adhere to a matrix in the form of centuries of resemblances, categories and distinct species, the tyranny of a language. A language is a matrix. Everything is supposed to cohere around the 'average case' which becomes mythical in its turn and masks other resemblances or other contrarieties. Whence man's revengeful violence against language, his desperate attempts to escape from resemblances, his denials, his 'madness'. Even though the analytical operation (taking two cases as dissimilar) may be inventive and emancipatory, the meaning of this operation remains the long-term conformity to the matrix, the complicity with that long procession of centuries which vary the average case. Above all, statistics is the ultimate consequence of this complicity.\nThe smallest units of statistics are not the individual cases, but the groups of resemblance which are predicated of different cases (Hobbes' colligationes).

    "The logical relation that holds between the entity and its types unfolds before the listener's ear. Because of this unfolding in time, the taxonomy is a hierarchy.\n\nBut as Meilaender himself admits at one point, logicians in Aristotle's day did not really believe in hierarchies. They seemed too like chains, and they limited the freedom of genera to contribute what they could to substances they involved. Might genera have played a somewhat diminished role?\n\nYet another issue comes up with logs and taxonomies. Aristotle uses the same word (logos) to mean \"reason\" and \"speech\". Of course, speech needs reasons, but does reasoning require speech? Is logos only a matter of dialogical reasoning, or is there an \"internal\" logos as well? If a person knows something, must he or she articulate it verbally? Even in our own day, computers can make discoveries. But are these discoveries 'logical' or merely 'mathematical'?\n\nLogos plays a special role befitting the nature of human creatures living in the middle range of being.",
    "Note that if you subtract any of these properties, the utterance remains unambiguously on the same level. E.g. if we make it a smallish apple, or perhaps a smallish but still very green apple, we are on the level of \"an apple\", not yet on the later level of something larger, unpulpier, etc.\nI think this is what a lot of people mean when they refer to the 'level' of an utterance- it's not a matter of syntactical level (like in badly structured sentences like \"John and the nurse helped the young boy, who had twisted ...\"), but rather the degree of specificity by which you can name a thing. This may be fuzzy because similar objects or states may be coded by different sets of attributes, but then we usually clean up our act by honing in on the aspects that are most interesting, leaving out transitory ones or treat them as given, or whatever.\nThe nice thing about this as a specification for such a hierarchy (really it's more like a spectrum running in many dimensions) is that it makes it possible to specify a great deal about an utterance in a very simple way.",

Since associations move through the difference, the disparity (relations of disparity between the elements within a given representation), it follows that deduction moves through partial differences-partial expressions of the representation. As a consequence, equivalences take the same form as negatives: they relate contents established at different depths of the same essential general concept-friendly behavior toward men as opposed to women; Socrates' pride as opposed to his humiliation with respect to his socratic circle of disciples.

Propositions compose propositions of propositions and propositions compose propositions of difference. Perhaps propositions embed propositions of propositions and propositions embed propositions of difference.",

    "In dealing with its protagonist, a novel is constructed following a complex narrative of redoublings, which renders communicable a (differential) beyond it is unable to know. Propositions in this discourse are therefore not so much explanatory ones or objective judgements as attention shifters on objects that are both strange and irreducible to what seems clear. The statements take on a figure between the perverse pleasure of desire and the strange speech of the more than one Other, (already) encountered. They work their enchantment by consenting to imprint their strange presence in a space devoid of markers. It is also here that we can notice that propositions are interwined with affective modalities \u2013 e.g., in viewing Mr. Bellop as a good grandfather, waiting dutifully by the window.",

Panini cautions regarding transposition of petrified forms that \"in letters, every virtue is a fault\" (Panini 112). Philosophy as drawing from the inside of perception, and as not merely impression, though is the only exception to Panini's dictum to non- abstraction because it does not set up a peculiar \"artificial house\" of concepts or representations.

    "The root of the problem is that contradiction is already required on the material level (or, at the very least, the dialectics of coenition, the development of the characters which necessarily passes through an internal opposition and a combat). A black halo moves around the white horses and princess in Buson's painting of Ursa Major,15 and in the Odyssey there are more than two of everything, while in The Iliad the true combatant is not Achilles but Patroclus. What is involved, however (complementarily), is also a complexity of contradictions within each character: Achilles, moved to pity for Homer, remains within the limits of the epic. The same uncompromising coenition comprises lust and remorse, cruelty and subornation.",
    "Suppose a text contains the sentence: 'He speaks.' Speaking, as we know, introduces a human being into the pure repetition of an impersonal language. So in what manner does the proposition 'He speaks' turn out to be not innocent, but rather questionable and even false, in regard to what it ought to say? In what manner does the individuating of proper names and the differential link which they constitute turn out to be in a specific and even excessive manner problematic? Under what conditions can propositions begin to be ghosts in the dialogue which refuses to be spoken, even though it is inhabited by speaking instead of being spoken (despite the agreement of all its partners)?\nWherein does the proposition found or foundering begin? Under what conditions does it come back 'at once general' (injustice) and 'individual' (rectification)?",

    "Susanne Langer notes that a feeling persists among critics and successive generations of readers, however greatly developed their sophistication, that there is a \"mystery\" of fictional conclusion where everything \"finally\" is brought together, adding too much time and too much content to the fictional activity, leaving it unexplained and unexplained unsaid.[24] But what kind of \"mystery\" is this? Above all, I think, a pretext sustained by criticism over fiction to connect expectations and fictive destinies. The fact that every work of art is immediately interpreted shows that all of its spectators draw from it a sum of unreal deductions, signifying in arithmetical fashion all the simple formulas of resolution and consummation that inundate art criticism from beginning to end. Line or style versus death is the chief arithmetical formula; or, love and possession versus death; or, the transfer or translation from life to style and love versus death. Such a deduction strikes me as intrinsically and dramatically impossible. Depending on which character functions as the analytical center, a surplu: no suspense, for the suspense already has taken place at the originarity of meaning in which a previously predetermined straight line (constituted by an arousal/Placed over it in a signifying accumulation that has cast everything forward, placed even by a set of simultaneous circumstances and by previous fictions produced by the interpreter (the critic and the adolescent reader); a foreigner, a lunatic, gives birth to stories resembling other stories and imagining other interpretations (sorties: - statements of affect and work serving only as pretexts that bring the writer out of his work). We know the kind of history critics have constructed around Schreber. It is the sole history that matters to them; everything else is supplement. The same can be said of interpretation, which pretends that everything adds up and adds up everything. From the primitive point of view of interpretation in the clinic, there is no suspense, for the suspense already has taken place at the originarity of desire, for which a form has already been taken up with a content it has subtracted from another arrangement called reality; for the primitive interpreter, there is no beginning for the reason that primitive interpretation already is.",

They institute negritude in a narrowly literary sense; they restore history.\nWhich is S. Rather, two S's instead of one.

    "Does the complex totalization usually performed via rigorous logic prove more faithless, less trusty, at the level of romance? Poe may surely be suspected to this end, with his fictions' reliance on statement, even though the exigencies of storytelling ensure that the limit-statement is rare and inaccessible for the most part. Block the choice or exertion of the signifier at a given point and discover what follows from the ensuing insurrectionary movement. The political divisions of an earlier regime yield in a vague interior war. What characterizes the liminal regime is what comes to the surface: irreducible traits render factions questionable or discredit them. A free-floating war destroys parties or renders them at the mercy of one trait that stages a coup. The march of brutality unfolds through secession at the points where the regime totters under the weight of crimes and blunders. Slow trial evolves into a perverse progression, its procedural logic now obsolete. It happens that doers are adjudged as much by their passions, affective defects, as by haplessly tracing a fatality.

    "What are the requirements for theory to provide something like a critique and a theory of fictions - ironically enough in Leibnizean terms? Recognising that the enigmas of fictions have a language of species character, the natural expectation would rest upon the idea (already done justice to through the solutions found for propositional statements by a Lewis or by an Armstrong) that an hypothesis managed to find the appropriate system of comparisons or the right analogy or affinities or regularities (precisely as specified in such a theory?). These would replace empirical general confirmations and God/Nature's transcendent decisions upon fictional results. It follows that the style of this theory would not be calculative even in cases where mathematics may well give us the measure of problems - but rather analogical. For while we sometimes encounter wager analogues, they never take their 'value' from the risk which anyone may be said to calculate, or indeed gain or lose (wins or losses always depend upon a ground given by Nature and God, founded in turn on the eternal justice of eternity).",
    "Propositions are always incomplete in relation to what is posited and to the positer. Nietzsche, for example, wrote in Philosophy in the Tragedy of the Old Testament: 'I suspect that we have here the first and from now on the only wearisome repetition of a problem in philosophy, the problem posed first by Descartes, viz. how long must we then have to live in order not to lose patience and reject something with which we are dissatisfied every time we verify an answer?' To be sure, against Descartes, What is being postulated here? A method? Not entirely. For instance, this answer must reflect undesirable characteristics which lead us to lose patience, 'as soon as we' verify an answer; but it also reflects desirable characteristics which invite us to take on this labour of verifying the answers (and even of posing questions).",
    "If direct statement is styled to the make believe that untethered rationality can bring everything under the central power of its functionality, then can we afford to accept the conflict between language and being (purity)?

This position appears to rest upon the implied dismissal of \"early Linguistic philosophy,\" which means that it flourished in its heydays of operation even though we treated it as forgotten. Were Martin Stone so commanded by a nigh timeless truth then he would have leaned first towards some proposal as to degree of location as compatible as was its activity belonging to human action universal , although that of modal logics against property relations. Somewhere in this argument is proposed an existing relation between monotonic derivations and probability measures that function with the least members distinguishible from nested interpolations.

    "For example, Whitman's affirmation of multiplicity as such: \"Not anyone or anything, but identity is everywhere, I, whatever else, am tumbled forth , hairs and all, and with laughter , Yes, identity, integument itself is face grinning through its mask of aspects.\" But the inherent insolubility of such a statement rests neither with an ontic absurdity that would be responsible for the failure of the statement - this is a reason Freud gave when speaking of ultimate, unreadable barriers behind all muddable subjects - but on a symbolic level insofar as the signifier falls short of the subject, and when the subject falls short of the mask it would claim to wear (\"integument itself\"). Whitman has slipped up all right, as much on the plane of content as of form: behind his affirmation is no subject other than the murmur of desire itself, the refrain, the always that it sings in order to enchant someone.",
    "My immediate reply to this question, which has just occurred to me though it's the sort of thing I should have known how to reply to long ago, is personal: my favourite literary characters would be Caliban (The Tempest) and Job (The Book of Job) - Flaubert was no doubt influenced here by the same Jewish and Moslem sources which I oinised by images of marvel and nightmare, which slowly broaden out into apocalyptic visions of brass skies and blazing oceans. This whole book is, as it were, preparing us for the dramatic flood that Poe finally lets loose on us a fifth of the way through; there is an age-old and highly formal appropriateness to what finally happens when death, often previewed, suddenly sweeps in for good. These Ligeian moribundities hardly prepare us for the scarcely believable finale when Poe completes the depressing picture by confiding his own speech impediments. Madness, incompetence, death. This gloomy prospect, this giddying swerves into a cry for mercy, an elaborate joke about lostfound sanity, becomes all consuming:\nWhat can there be in common between life and poetry?",
    "It is customary to capture this separate domain in the ripest phrasing: discontinuity, or the short-circuit. \"Henry James's style is as subtle and richly expressive as any in American literature, but it resists synopsis because he separates his actions and derives implications, instead of relating them and exhibiting them in physical actions and concrete immediacies. His theme is actions, but his style indirectly expresses them in shifts, in implications, in concerns. It follows that each significant action is a plateau in a continuous becoming, or a crystallization of implicit dynamisms.\"10\nWe find two sorts of omissions and cryptic expressions in his narratives - one involved in the progression of the narrative action itself, the other more concerned with character motivation. The former are of a purely rhythmic nature and mark temporal ellipses in narrative action, while the latter silence the subject when it moves toward the expression of emotions that the author evidently found too intractable and painful to depict in detail. Such silences immediately arise at those junctures in the subject when affects become too strongly implicated.",
    "How could there be vicarious experience, a kind of experience that is experienced nowhere? How could there be, in general, theoretical experience of a non-empirical type? Has not all experience, by virtue of being objectivised, lost not only its need but even its relation to the subject who undergoes it? In terms of real reading and fictive reading, how is it possible to surpass being and the Self? The naive solution involves two clearly distinct movements: the inward movement of substantive over-transition of this difference (as inflection of a function, such as it is employed in the differential calculus). Nevertheless, it is still difficult to cease regarding the differential direct relation between x and y. By introducing a third curve, ax = by - c, the differential relation between x, y and z is transformed into algebraic form. To an 'external' relation x = y between qualitatively different magnitudes a simple 'internal' relation y = x between qualities is substituted.",
    "The role of propositions here is well expressed by the commas employed: they indicate limits of knowledge, but commas also enclose what cannot be known (hence the other sense of the propositions, 'what we don't know'). In short, propositions indicate what is unthought in what is thought. This is precisely what the teeth mean. For teeth are the elements which proliferate in the inside of a body; they designated not primarily what must go outside in order to be thought (un argument plan cur ) , but the inside itself, that which thinks only in the event. (This entire question will be seen to run parallel to that of the role of names, in the ordinary scheme: names as attributes designate the unthought by connection with what is thought, whereas the question is raised as to what designation means - in other words, the doubt or difference which comes to attach to the 'white sheet of paper' on which the name points to nothing.) This is why Landscape Painting seems so important in its fundamental effect on the logic and dialectic of unthought; this crucial painting consists precisely in bringing forth the Idea by means of the power of thinking.",
    "What are they in themselves? We start in general logical propositional statements and draw further and further away from their ideal forms. Referential statements always have others behind them, and we continue in search of a referential power unhampered by measurement. In any arbitrary narrative there is no singular point to which one can return, for it is difficult even to say what this argument intends to verify. Rather, at any qualitative projection there are always transcendent fissures in these forms. Language of old is especially prone to this flaw.

Accidental coalesces with universal at the region of instability separate from its rigorous pattern.\n\nWe were in fact allowed, as public (army artist), to delve into unexpected and terminal places: hospitals, ruined buildings, objects left in no-man's-land.

    "What is the signifigance of propositions in the reading of poetry, wherein we maintain somewhat different canons of truth?\nI maintain that the shared principle here is concern with a certain material economy. Though there are in fact no unexamined clauses in Soi's Greek, his text remains studiously silent on the long-term fortunes of nonessential bits of information (his back-flourishing is restrained). Though there are no unexamined clauses in much modern fiction, the syntactical echoing itself still goes hand-in-hand with a slight boldness in the baring of social or narrative truth (cf. DeLillo or Rushdie). The same goes even for what I would call verbally dense poetry: A.R. Ammons' lengthily run-on prose is also lengthily run-on verse, retaining density throughout as it shifts from lines with an implication of cumulative drive toward closer observation (King Lear) to lines whose final markients remind us that the refocusing of attention was no advance (Young Goodman Brown).

    "If a proposition has a precise content, the imaginary machine to which it corresponds is precise as well: a field of objectifiable components. But the collective function frees the proposition of all systematization through a de-territorialization and deterritorialization of its concept (in which the particles are liberated and come to the line with whatever they pick up in the black holes). The exactitude with which the machine thus liberated meshes with a given content (the daily circumstances of Anna, of Emma Bovary) will bring us closer to the actual mystery from which it springs. Imagine that under the conditions of a collective conferring (even a theatrical one) and in the time for which it held sway, every molecule issuing from a graphitized cutting edge and caught in the line, in a proper fashion, is perceived to hook up with another molecule of signifiance, which by opening or closing in the duration of the act produces at the given moment a proposition translated or \"improperly\" forced into signifiance. If a proposition has a precise content, the imaginary machine to which it corresponds has a precise form: if it is collective, that collectivity is entirely transparent, all the more since it is itself collective, immanent, and contemporary becoming.",

Suppose that it suffices to provide the subject with a principle of identity (I): under the action of the language which it understands, the subject steps over into another I. By accepting I' as internal, the subject acknowledges the presence of language; by testing I' against perceived reality, it constitutes an empirical I and escapes as fast as possible from the generality of I'. Two different facts correspond to two distinct actions: the test against reality, in other words the obedience of I to the principle situated beyond doubt; and straightforward assimilation, in other words the acceptance of proposed principles.

    "(Much more to read?) Is this vectoring a ray that the reader projects rather than receives? Or the presence of something outside the book (his right arm against his side, his left leg along the outside of her thigh, his pelvis balancing delicately on her body as he presses above her, breathing in her ear)? Up down left right; within reaching distance; shiny with sweat; his tongue flicking out to taste the curve where throat meets shoulder blade; feel its ridges under his tongue; orange-peel skin; breaking her with heavy breathing across her back; slippery with sweat; bushy with curling grey hairs; drummy hollow; sucking to the hollow muscle with griping turnings (his groin wet on her buttock); moaning in her ear; quicker, tighter fluid tangles wetting further his groin; tongue-out weaker griping; drop wet fat head on her arched back a minute longer and breathe quick shallow pants on her hair, sorting out smell and taste; aromas big around his nose; blow nose quietly 5 inches up her sweaty spine.",
    "Or else it's a plateau. The different meanings swerve off from the tract of a plateau-prosa: say taut analyst, aesthesiog savant, executive idiot. And the variegated fields and thickets might also merge beyond possibility of analysis. Hierensity of beauty-idea on and around beauty-temperament at circle of friends. Always the unique and multiple senses in the a, each ultimate sense attaching all others to it in trajectories and paths ... Good stories often begin strangely, interestingly clothed in all those identical garments called significance or content ...\nThe idea that signs or dress components somehow determine their sensings or their senses might account, perhaps, for Archagenteneuregg's power. It might easily adjust to the distinctive attributes of a new agent who need only pronounce his/her name--and lo cameras swing around, lamps flare up, tensions crackle: God is dead. No idea comprehends its own absolute activity and renders that activity proportionate to the images.",
    "The question of the unit-destruction and reformation of binary units remains important. Jack BWoman opts for a sentence with up periods. This does not work for me. Neruda says that for every ten things you are trying to say, you end up saying one; what is the process of transformation that he underwent to make that happen? Why would i want to turn into mike? I have different styles, a little one and what you might call a bigna big one. Over there I wrote BWoman, and yesterday I mailed it off to Ann Ferguson. My joy of becoming is complete. But the idea of abreaction is not so far off here.\nwould be to integrate the bipolar structure, using a van Urk-L Mann diagram:\nHere the horizontal arrows describe the chain letter effect of temporality and continuity, the domains of power, while the two set of arrows describe what I call the rhizomatic pattern of connections, escapes, issuing into feedback loops. What is critical is that the dialectic in the parentheses must go on and on, abstracting the components into meta- sets of strata or levels, which is to say, rhizomes. This is Blissymbols.\nFormally, written and oral styles are quite different.",
    "Its cardinal point is not in the direction it points, but in the direction from which it has come. A (proper or improper) hyperbola of a sentence (though less mathematical than Copernican, geocentric and with its centre in the idea rather than the word). And while each bolded word, phrase and clause individually heads off in a direction, it is only in the context of their collective occurrence that an overall Gestalt takes on a meaningful trajectory --not directly out of the world of Poe, Hawthorne and Melville but into the continental pragmatism of William James and George Santayana.\n- - - -\nLike Taos, Eagle on Red Hill suggests infinity. But not so much with regard to what it depicts; rather, to consider the painter who painted it. It is a painting of a painting. Like any true work of art it leaps forth from the hand of the master painter. But this painting is a young woman's painting of a painting. Two worlds are contained here: imagination and technique that is its vehicle. Within these two worlds, time emerges.",
    "Wanting to be free, but bound to things. What allows us to consider \"eleven workers were injured when a railroad car carolling with bags of feed poured its contents at the base of one of our transmission towers, and the seethed grain flowed like lava into the station.\" Gave up, let go. Note: in a narratology discussion, our of clauses are frequently \"bowed,\" \"bent,\" \"curved,\" etc., at the end of a sentence appearing at transitional moments within sentences remarks that certain adjectives and adverbs \"have a peculiar value in the process of statement; they constitute either one pole or the other of the two complementary statements into which the statement is divided, or else they represent the statement as it emerges from the process of action of which it is the product.\" Let go, repetitions. We are rather weak at letting go in American culture, even those among us for whom this is, ostensibly, a virtue: in what is produced as a result is a heightened state of Repeto, a tender compassion; in seeking to produce this sort of ending, however, we risk, necessarily, severe parataxis and the resultant loss of euphony, a loss that we suffer for the sake of our writing's greater veracity, valorizing honesty over the falseness of our preferences.",
    "Things keep pushing out. At what point does this pushing out cease to merely present new meanings but actually pick out the necessary ones, tenses and intensities? Perhaps when the next clause springs out of competition or compatibility with the prior clause; but each with a different angle and vector-force. The challenge to every writer is to push out far enough, take on new imperatives. The pusher-outers. The instruction to the student is one of maximum range, maximum extension.\nImpossible exit point is the originary act, the primal contraction which defines destiny. But can one get away from it? No. One must accept it, base everything upon it, whilst simultaneously pushing out from it in an infinity of directions and angles. Accepting the contract and its conditions, learning its lessons, takes us back to Plato and the Idea of the Good. We can contract only with our own shadows, return only to our distorting mirrors. The only 'negation' is in this play of mirrors and reflections, in the interplay between differences and repetitions. Difference in repetition cannot be negated. It remains with us. Negation is a Platonic simplification. Likewise for negativity, which really always has something to do with negation. A philosophy of the contract therefore passes through a positive moment, an affirmative moment.",
    "What clause makes most proper meeting? Considering that reading runs forward, look down the tangent in hopes it reached the end of its particular arc by this time; or if not the originating clause can find the direction make sense yet. Curiosity check: though not compelling, let read in declarative key. The thing is complete; the animal desire of fullness prompts the wormhole of completed statement into absorbed truth-provision block, protecting the house of words; and in this mood of afterload wakefulness maybe go back to read more slowly later--beset once loneliness wakes and says goodby you knew this would happen upset upset surely this was not experience perhaps because do it will sleepy let the he dropped so what the kid three sit down basketball broad your lesson boredom sit alone drink a two count looks at began some things love end.",
    "Get it? The last sentence is a model Notation of the process and quality of reading in all its complexity. Where does it, the act of abstracting the Universe Mode, close? Or does it close? Does it have end-reading, or is it always renewing, removing itself from its moment to its next and endlessly? That, again, is a deconstructive gesture. OK--that's me talking.\n\nThe Last Sentence Of Pynchon's V. Bookending, Body Memory and Whispering Pages\n\nHark! In the aether comes a whisper, Soundlessly I think my life and all its print Has been but thanks for the spell instilled In me by thee.",
    "Think of the degree to which the thought or view continues on, up a kind of read-ensemble structure, or just the angle of departure from the previous sentence. Of course there is usually some as-yet unexperienced remaindering of the reader concerned, that s/he does not simply zip off into total alternative-view Territory S, but there are limits. Even with a clause, one often feels seeing the end of the matter up ahead, even with not experiencing the satisfaction yet of that which waits at the ventral wall of that angle.\nIOWA FRIEND: To me all this distresses \"the idea of the angle of egress.\" It's so undiagrammatic and undoable, so out of all atemporal keep going. I want to renaturalize the image of reading as a line going across the page , a vector of attention, proceeding (slope) through the sentence like a line on, in, against and through time until it hits an irregular pause and arrives at a place or short field where some spasm of consummation can occur.\nIOWA GUY: You still have to distinguish here between reading S and reading S2. I mean, your line has its angle, its egress moment, reaches for what it's not this time into the next sentence O but not over the edge! And it does so quite to the contrary of any notion of keeping going. Just for fun this morning I got out my previously mentioned white binder and copied some phrases from Stuart Gilbert on Proust's style from his famous red (!) 1933 essay \"Proust,\" originally published in book form in 1952 (whose author would have been 83 when he \"first discovered\" Tom Pears), and one section on how difficult it was to translate Proust's style reads in particular:\n\"The difficulty of translating Proust into English lies above all in his use of the French subjunctive tense, which is far richer than the corresponding English tense.",
    "(Poetry as splenetic excresence, compositional flatulence.) The point where it 'ends' is dependent upon where the reader stops, coming in time to an angle of disinterest more acute or obtuse than the one before, as might be expected in a conversation which speaks beyond a beginning and has no explicit end. (There may also be the question of anticipated or unprompted ellipsis, or counterpointed or countered ellipses. There are many ways to play with punctuation.) To address the reader directly can be like yelling across a field to a neighbor, or like addressing someone across continents to whom the recipient cannot respond in any practical way-it raises the question of whether what is 'said' truly matters. Perhaps the period means almost nothing to someone who reads rapidly and has no sense of style. A practiced or skilful reader will know how to hold the sentences against each other and even make bold claims of theme and structure from this arborescent perspective. As will anyone who likes to think while they read-while they skate on their skates, while they write poetry, while they express love. Indeed the radical reader uses the period to push back against all that makes sense of texts that are communicated by blocks of words. Any reader who understands the radical role of the interpreter must necessarily know the element of performance that gives form to large-scale poetic design in Pindar, Hlderlin and Mallarme. Performance is intercommunication across great distances. An authentic poet creates order in and through the seeming disorder of interpretation. But today it is hard to be anything but a radical reader. Some are even tamed, near-tabula-rasa. Times have changed.\nThere could be a certain, familiar aesthetic that is spatiotemporally elevated or distanced but relationally superficial in relation to the text (again, perhaps all along the text, not just at the end). If so, then to want depth is to want an immersion in echo, and perhaps to feel detached from surface-or would this merely be another surface?",
    "Alter your angle of approach to see the relation different.\nHard to suggest.\nDoctor Gelb turned to look at Kim, who was standing on the other side of the huge greywackered pit, shading his eyes and peering down into the hole which had been a cereal box. \"Well, I'll be damned,\" said Kim. Doctor Gelb turned back to look down into the pit again. A grey sauraptured lizard was clambering over the fractured sidevoices of the cereal box. It looked back at Dr. Gelb with its neck curved, flicked its tail, scrambled over the edge of the hole and disappeared in the long grass. By eight that night, after several lukewarm showers, Kim had completed unpacking his luggage and was ready to eat. At dinner he sat with the family, Felix and Agatha Gelb, and their daughter Cindy. Kim discovered that he liked both the Gelbs a great deal. They reminded him of people he had known in high-school: intelligent, unsophisticated and full of well-intentioned half-baked notions. They had none of the air of self-sufficient isolation which was one of the hallmarks of Goodrich people's relations with adults. Kim dug these people. Dinner was excellent, a huge roast served with crisp French fries, soft buttery rolls and strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was homemade, as was evidenced by faint lines of beeswax around the corkinger cork in the corked preserving-jar on the cork-lined sideboard. Kim had never eaten anything this good in his life. After dinner they sat around the big circular stonewalled fireplace and talked while Cindy cleared the table and washed up. The living-room was sunk down about two yards below ground level. Its only windows were circular openings set in the top of the wall. The walls were lined with shelves packed with books, and there was a long polished stone table standing in the centre of the room.",
    "We must continue, eh? and whether we do, we can stop when we arrive at what?\nThus not the linear and simple trajectory of the page-turner. Loosened from linearity, docked somewhere in space and constantly on the way to dock in space somewhere else--along dimensions co-ordinate with the sequence of words and punctuation marks along the line of its proliferations. The whole text produced through transforming each small section on the way, taking each as yet another departing point bearing an insistent relation with the whole which entails its continual precession and constitution. Transformations following transformations induced by chosen conditions--painting grammar Greenquist is aiming for is based on all manner of rules forms restrictions contracts assignments, crazy desserts probs schools teachers generals majors sororities fraternities associtions, hip destruction, groovy conspiracy and beauty competition judges seeded all over in Space somewhere else but at various levels. And probably best to not have border permission, not even a permit, decide to drive there simply by happening to pass by in a state of pure permission to continue onward aimless. But apparently permission resides in a way in everything of discourse, specifically as it approaches the period. An error which enables one to finalize one or another supporting logic or even aesthetic form (thus enabling you get straight A's in this type of English class while pursuing Bluequistian poetic practice). Perhaps potentials reside along corridors of mutual interiority created between bits of nearly unrelated clutter compulsively related, cross-calculated through stratum with subtle equations between the dynamics regulating mathematics and its autonomous insets. In this model, cryptography becomes composition proper beneath a surface that is illegible: glimpses taken by the reader are treated as suggestions which serve to either disrupt or buttress aspects of specific sections when they are so used in some turbulent higher-level synthesis projected into the model of reality astheir overall effect.\nIt is due to this alien hyperactivity coexistent with the opposite productivity of such belatedness (HyperCard's extended or providential metaphor ... chronological time no longer knows how to be legendary time; the mortal gift can now constitute itself only through mortal coefficient, only by choosing its gods outside the universal structure) that Homer's poems are polyphonic or have a polyphony of styles within them ... ....Modern criticism has shown too little awareness of the extent to which it may be performing inside his figure ... That presence of polyphony which could no longer sustain itself at the same level of sonority is displaced downwards or forced into a stratum thinly coated with types-forms which, like allegory and the concept, always imply that underneath, more radical displacement es and death.",
    "At any rate, one continues which is analogous to off-staging in a drama: when we say \"Keep going!\"our correspondent understands exactly, frequently produces the same effect in issuing communicated directions or emphased descriptive argot to other goers, let me say. Trouble that a tree becomes based on grammar, divided against itself (\"Jake, describing a rapidly vanishing herd, used 'running off an incline so that their movement deceived the eye'\"), rather than on grammatical articulation - we tend, given arrowhead proportion, to simplify the description for our correspondent. Tree throws one marvelously exposed angle into and onto the succeeding, originating phases. Perhaps that angle is represented and derisible by consecutive lower-case variation--in other terms and interpretations, the movement prior to closing brackets belongs connected to the prior vector, become acutely or obtusely acute, strangled at its other increase, which two assessments are observed in instances approaching 200 joints. \"How do trees grow.-in the same way legs walk and eyes so much eyeage back one learns more about conscious ratios.\" PWA.
